	// the nexuses of other threads (in any order), performs connections

	// reports itself constructed, it may not add any new nexuses nor
	// perform connections, and whatever it has defined becomes visible to
	// the other threads.
	// 2. Readiness: the thread waits for all the dependent threads to
	// become ready, before it declares itself ready. The whole application
	// becomes ready when all the threads in it are ready.
	//
	// Note that both stages imply the dependency graphs, but these graphs
	// may be very different. So far it looks more likely that these graphs
	// will have the opposite direction of the edges. The cycles are not
	// allowed in either of the graphs. The cycles get detected and 
	// mean the application initialization failure.
