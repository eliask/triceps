// of the Triead to a single thread that owns it. The Triead and TrieadOwner
// creation is wrapped even farther, through App. The owner class is an Starget
// by design, it must be accessible to one thread only. 
//
// Also includes all the control information that should not be visible
// from outside the owner thread.
//
// And also includes a reference to the App. This allows to avoid the reference
// loops, with references going in the direction TrieadOwner->App->Triead.
//
// When the TrieadOwner is destroyed, the Triead gets marked as dead
// and gets cleared and disconnected from the App (but not disposed of until
// the reference count goes to 0).
