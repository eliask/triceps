// Nexus is the machinery that keeps a queue of rowops (their inter-thread
// representations) for passing between the threads. The queue is common
// between all the labels and provides a common order for them. More exactly,
// there might be up to two queues: one "downstream" and one "upstream".
// But the initial goal is to have one per nexus.
//
// Besides the queues, a nexus is used to export the assorted row types
// and table types. They live in their separate sub-namespaces.
//
// The Nexuses could live right on the level under App but in case of the
// deadlocks this would make tracing the cause difficult (i.e. thread A
// waits for a nexus to be defined by thread B, while thread B waits for
// a nexus to be defined by thread A). So each Nexus is associated with and 
// nested under a certain Triead.
