// The basic execution unit ties together a buch of tables, code and scheduling.
// It lives inside one thread and always executes sequentially. But nothing really
// stops a thread from having multiple execution units in it.
//
// The scheduling queue is composed of nested frames. The next rowop to execute is
// always taken from the front of the innermost frame. If a rowop is completed
// and its frame is found empty, the frame gets popped. The outermost frame
// is never popped from the stack even when it's completely empty.
//
// There are 4 ways to add rowops to the queue:
// 1. To the tail of the outermost frame. It's to schedule some delayed processing
//    for later, when the whole current queue is consumed.
//    [schedule]
// 2. To the tail of the current frame. This delays the processing of that rowop until
//    the processing of the current rowop completes.
//    [fork]
// 3. To the tail of another (ancestor) frame, pointed to by the FrameMark. 
//    This delays the processing of that rowop until that ancestor rowop completes.
//    [loopAt]
// 4. To push a new frame, add the rowop there, and immediately start executing it.
//    This works like a function call, making sure that all the effects from that
//    rowop are finished before the current processing resumes.
//    [call]
//
// Since the Units in different threads need to communicate, it's an Mtarget.
//
// When an Exception is thrown, the state of the unit will be left in some
// consistent shape, so that the execution could potentially be continued.
// The queue will be cleared to the same condition as if the call had returned normally.
// But if the operation consists of multiple parts, such as a tray, there
// might be no way to tell, what where went broken, and which parts were
// executed and which weren't, and this may mess up the application logic. 
// So the Exceptions should really be treated as fatal errors.
