// A label provides a way to call some user-defined code to handle an event.
// This works by subclassing: define your own subclass and define the method 
// execute() in it that does what you need. It's a functor object.
// A label handles the rows of only one type.
// A label belongs to exactly one execution Unit. If you need to do the same
// processing in multiple units, make a separate instance of your label
// subclass for each unit.
//
// The labels may be chained together: after a label executes its own handling
// code, it may call the other labels on the same input row.
// The chaining is a common idiom used by the tables and other state-keeping
// elements: a table defines its own output label with empty handling code where
// it sends the information about updates in the table. To receive these updates,
// the user may define his own labels and chain them to the table's label.
// Similarly a table defines its input label. The user can then chain that input
// label to other labels and make the table automatically receive the updates.
