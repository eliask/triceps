The Perl interface, gets installed as a Perl module.

Generated with:
h2xs -O -n Triceps --use-old-tests

The old-style tests are used because as it turns out not all recent
versions of Linux (Fedora 11 in particular) have the module Test::Simple
installed by default.  It can be installed from CPAN
<http://search.cpan.org/~mschwern/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Simple.pm>,
but the old tests are just as good for my purposes.

See Biceps.0 in the tag 0.99-pre for the original clean as-generated
directory, so that the manual changes can be traced easily.  It's named
Biceps.0 because it was generated in the days when the project was named
Biceps.

The magic setting for the verbose test progress is TEST_VERBOSE=1.
To see the nice diff of multi-line values, set PERL_TEST_DIFF="diff -c".
