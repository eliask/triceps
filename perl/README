The Perl interface, gets installed as a Perl module.

Generated with:
h2xs -O -n Biceps --use-old-tests

The old-style tests are used because as it turns out not all recent
versions of Linux (Fedora 11 in particular) have the module Test::Simple
installed by default.  It can be installed from CPAN
<http://search.cpan.org/~mschwern/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Simple.pm>,
but the old tests are just as good for my purposes.

Biceps.0 contains the clean as-generated directory,
so that the manual changes can be traced easily.
I'm still learning how to generate the Perl makefiles
and such right, so I need these crutches.

The magic setting for the verbose test progress is TEST_VERBOSE=1.
