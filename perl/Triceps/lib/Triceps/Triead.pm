# Start a new Triead in the current thread, without creating a new thread.
# This is convenient for the tests, to put this Triead at the end of
# the pipelne and thus concentrating all the ok() calls in it, preventing
# the races in the test results.
# But it can also be useful in the real-world program as an anchor that
# connectes the multithreaded Triceps model to the rest of the application.
# An easy way to send a set of data through the model is to create a writer
# facet on a reverse nexus (for the unliited buffering) for the input data,
# and whatever needed reader facets on the output data. Then send all the
# input data to the writer facet and read the results from the reader facet(s).
#
# This function won't return until the pseudo-thread's main function
# returns.
#
# The options are the same as for start() with an addition:
#
# harvest => 0/1
# After the main function exits, automatically run the harvesrer.
# If you set it to 0, don't forget to call the harvester after this 
# function returns. (Default: 1)
# This option will not be passed to main().
#
# makeApp => 0/1
# Before doing anything, create the App. This is convenient because typically
# this thread becomes the "anchor" of the App that creates all the other
# threads.
# (Default: 1)
