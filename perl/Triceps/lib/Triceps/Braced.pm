# Per the syntax of the acceptable inputs for this module, the
# strings are quoted only once, and then they can be nested in braces
# any amount of times. On parsing back, you can split the nested
# braces any amount of times, and finally when you're ready to use
# a string, you need to unescape it once, to interpret any backslash escapes.
# This function interprets all the normal Perl substitutions.

	# per the braced syntax and don't need to be escaped, but when
	# the string is passed to Perl for interpretation, the quotes are
	# special and need to be escaped. The same applies to the dollar
	# signs, and pretty much any non-word symbol (except for the
	# backslash itself).
