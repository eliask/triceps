our $poll; # the poll object
our $cur_cli; # the id of the current client being processed
our $srv_exit; # exit when all the client connections are closed

# Writing to the output buffers. Will also trigger the polling to
# actually send the output data to the client's socket.
#
# XXX A caveat is that if the client had already disconnected, this
# will create all kinds of mess.
