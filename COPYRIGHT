The Triceps project is dual-licensed under 2 licenses:
  1. GNU LGPL v3 (Triceps version), as specified in the file LGPL
  2. If LGPL is not good enough for you, a Custom license issued by Sergey Babkin.

Any third-party contributions to the project must also be licensed under a dual license:
  1. GNU LGPL v3 (Triceps version), as specified in the file LGPL
  2. A BSD-style license. The intent is to permit the inclusion of the contributions
  with the Custom licensed version.

The intent of the Triceps version of LGPL v3 is to specify that any general
Complex Event Processing engines based on Triceps are considered direct
derived works of Triceps and fall under full GPL provisions (or a Custom license),
unlike the end-user applications.

Parts of this package have been included from other packages, and are covered by
their own license. Such code includes:
	* Pthreads Wrapper library
