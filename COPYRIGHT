The Triceps project is dual-licensed under 2 licenses:
  1. GNU LGPL v3 (Triceps version), as specified in the file LGPL
  2. If LGPL is not good enough for you, a Custom license issued by Sergey Babkin.
  To obtain a Custom license, contact Sergey Babkin at <babkin@users.sf.net>.

Any third-party contributions to the project must also be licensed under a dual license:
  1. GNU LGPL v3 (Triceps version), as specified in the file LGPL
  2. A BSD-style license. The intent is to permit the inclusion of the contributions
  with the Custom licensed version.

The intent of the Triceps version of LGPL v3 is to close the loophole of
someone making a thin wrapper around the library and reselling it as a
commercial product.  LGPL v3 Triceps version specifies that any general Complex
Event Processing engines based on Triceps are considered direct derived works
of Triceps and fall under full GPL provisions (or a Custom license), unlike the
end-user applications. This kind of loophole has been known to be abused
between the commercial companies in the past.

The difference between the text of the original LGPL version 3 and the Triceps
version is as follows:

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
An Application solves a particular user task and does not provide a 
general Complex Event Processing functionality.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library, if this subclass does not
provide direct access to the Library interface from outside of the
Application.

Parts of this package have been included from other packages, and are covered by
their own license. Such code includes:
    * Pthreads Wrapper library
