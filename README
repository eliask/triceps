Triceps is an innovative CEP (Complex Event Processing) engine. It implements
the event stream processing as a library embeddable in C++ and Perl.

For the build instructions, see BUILD.

For the documentation see doc/pdf and doc/html (if you didn't download the
release but checked out from SVN, these directories will be empty and the
documentation would have to be built from the docbook sources; see BUILD
for instructions).

The documentation of the latest features that haven't been collected into
an official release yet is written up as a blog at
http://babkin-cep.blogspot.com/ .
