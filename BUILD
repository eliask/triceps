Build
-----

The basic build procedure is:

	make all
	make test

The C++ libraries will be created under cpp/build.
The Perl libraries will be created under perl/Triceps/blib.

The tests are normally run with valgrind for the C++ part, without valgrind
for the Perl part. The reason is that Perl produces lots of false positives,
and the suppressions depend on particular Perl versions and are not
exactly reliable.

For more information. see the chapter "Building Triceps" in the Developer's 
Guide that can be found in the PDF or HTML form online on
http://triceps.sf.net or in doc/pdf, doc/html.
