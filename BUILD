How to build Biceps.
--------------------

The tested build environment is Linux Fedora 11. The Perl build system should make
it work automatically on the other Unix environments as well.

One known deficiency of the Fedora 11 is that its Perl package doesn't include the
module Test::Simple. Without it the tests won't work. Install it from CPAN
<http://search.cpan.org/~mschwern/Test-Simple/lib/Test/Simple.pm>.


To build:

	make all
	make test

To install:

	make install

To uninstall:

	make uninstall
