<h3>What is the CEP?</h3>

		<p>
		CEP stands for the Complex Event Processing.  If you look at Wikipedia,
		it has separate articles for the Event Stream Processing and the
		Complex Event Processing. In reality it's all the same thing, with the
		naming driven by the marketing. I would not be surprised if someone
		invents yet another name, and everyone will start jumping on that
		bandwagon too.
		</p><a class="indexterm" name="id519409"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id503020"></a><p>
		In general a CEP system can be thought of as a black box, where the
		input events come in, propagate in some way through that black box, and
		come out as the processed output events. There is also an idea that the
		processing should happen fast, though the definitions of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fast</span>&#8221;</span> vary
		widely.
		</p><p>
		If we open the lid on the box, there are at least three ways to think
		of its contents:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
		a spreadsheet on steroids
		</li><li class="listitem">
		a data flow machine
		</li><li class="listitem">
		a database driven by triggers
		</li></ul></div><a class="indexterm" name="id506263"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id520211"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id518524"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id521085"></a><p>
		Hopefully you've seen a spreadsheet before. The cells in it are tied
		together by formulas. You change one cell, and the machine goes and
		recalculates everything that depends on it. So does a CEP system. If we
		look closer, we can discern the CEP engine (which is like the
		spreadsheet software), the CEP model (like the formulas in the
		spreadheet) and the state (like the current values in the
		spreadsheet). An incoming event is like a change in an input
		cell, and the outgoing events are the updates of the values in the
		spreadsheet. 
		</p><p>
		Only a typical CEP system is bigger: it can handle some very complicated
		formulas and many millions of records. There actually are products that
		connect the Excel spreadsheets with the behind-the-curtain computations
		in a CEP system, with the results coming back to the spreadsheet
		cells. Pretty much every commercial CEP provider has a product
		that does that through the Excel RT interface. The way these models are
		written are not exactly pretty, but the results are, combining the nice
		presentation of spreadsheets and the speed and power of CEP.
		</p><p>
		A data flow machine, where the processing elements are exchanging
		messages, is your typical academical look at CEP. The events
		represented as data rows are the messages, and the CEP model describes
		the connections between the processing elements and their internal
		logic. This approach naturally maps to the multiprocessing, with each
		processing element becoming a separate thread. The hiccup is that the
		research in the dataflow machines tends to prefer the non-looped
		topologies. The loops in the connections complicate the things.
		</p><p>
		And many real-world relational databases already work very similarly to
		the CEP systems. They have the constraints and triggers propagating these
		constraints. A trigger propagates an update on one table to an update
		on another table. It's like a formula in a spreasheet or a logical
		connection in a dataflow graph.  Yet the databases usually miss two
		things: the propagation of the output events and the notion of being
		<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fast</span>&#8221;</span>.
		</p><p>
		The lack of propagation of the output events is totally baffling to me:
		the RDBMS engines already write the output event stream as the redo
		log. Why not send them also in some generalized format, XML or
		something? Then people realize that yes, they do want to get the output
		events and start writing some strange add-ons and aftermarket solutions
		like the log scrubbers. This has been a mystery to me for some 15
		years. I mean, how more obvious can it be? But nobody budges. Well,
		with the CEP systems gaining popularity and the need to connect them to
		the databases, I think it will eventually grow on the database vendors
		that a decent event feed is a competitive advantage, and I think it
		will happen somewhere soon. 
		</p><p>
		The feeling of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fast</span>&#8221;</span> or lack thereof has
		to do with the databases being stored on disks. The growth of CEP has
		coincided with the growth in RAM sizes, and the data is usually kept
		completely in memory. People who deploy CEP tend to want the
		performance not of hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands
		events per second. The second part of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fast</span>&#8221;</span> is connected with the
		transactions. In a traditional RDBMS a single event with all its
		downstream effects is one transaction. Which is safe but may cause lots
		of conflicts. The CEP systems usually allow to break up the logic into
		multiple loosely-dependent layers, thus cutting on the overhead.
		</p>

<h3>What led to Triceps</h3>

		<p>
		It had happened that I've worked for a while on and with the Complex Event
		Processing (CEP) systems. I've worked for a few years on the internals
		of the Aleri CEP engine, then after Aleri acquired Coral8, some on the
		Coral8 engine, then after Sybase gobbled up them both, I've designed
		and did the early implementation of a fair bit of the Sybase CEP R5.
		After that I've moved on to Deutsche Bank and got the experience from
		the other side: using the CEP systems, primarily the former Coral8,
		now known as Sybase CEP R4.
		</p><p>
		This made me feel that writing the CEP models is unnecessarily
		difficult. Even the essentially simple things take too much effort.
		I've had this feeling before as well, but one thing is to have it in
		abstract, and another is to grind against it every day. 
		</p><p>
		Which in turn led me to thinking about making my own Open Source CEP
		system, where I could try out the ideas I get, and make the streaming
		models easier to write. I aim to do better than the 1950's style, to
		bring the advances of the structured programming into the CEP world.
		</p><p>
		Thus the Triceps project was born. For a while
		it was called Biceps, until I've learned of the existence of a recearch
		project called BiCEP. It's spelled differently, and is in a
		substantially differnt area of CEP work, but it's easier to avoid
		confusion, so I went one better and renamed mine Triceps.
		</p><p>
		Since then I've moved on from DB, and I'm currently not using any CEP
		at work (though you never know what would happen), but Triceps has
		already gained momentum by itself.
		</p><p>
		The Triceps development has been largely shaped by two considerations:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
		It has to be different from the Sybase products on which I worked.
		This is helpful from both legal standpoint and from marketing
		standpoint: Sybase and StreamBase already have similar products that
		compete head to head. There is no use getting into the same fray
		without some major resources.
		</li><li class="listitem">
		It has to be small. I can't spend the same amount of effort on Triceps
		as a large company, or even as a small one. Not only this saves time
		but also allows the modifications to be easy and fast. The point of
		Triceps is to experiment with the CEP language to make it easy to use:
		try out the ideas, make sure that they work well, or replace them with
		other ideas. The companies with a large established product can't
		really afford the radical changes: they have invested much effort into
		the product, and are stuck with supporting it and providing
		compatibility into the future.
		</li></ul></div><a class="indexterm" name="id495781"></a><p>
		Both of these considerations point into the same direction: an
		embeddable CEP system. Adapting an integrated system for an embedded
		usage is not easy, so it's a good open niche. Yeah, this niche
		is not empty either.  There already is Esper.  But from a cursory look, it
		seems to have the same issues as Coral8/StreamBase. It's also
		Java-centric, and Triceps is aimed for embeddability into different 
		languages.
		</p><p>
		And an embeddable system saves on a lot of components.
		</p><p>
		For starters, no IDE. Anyway, I find the IDEs pretty useless for
		development in general, and especially for the CEP development. Though
		it comes handy once in a while for the analysis of the code and
		debugging.
		</p><p>
		No new language, no need to develop compilers, virtual machines,
		function libraries, external callout APIs. Well, the major goal of
		Triceps actually is the development of a new and better language. But
		it's one of these paradoxes: Aleri does the relational logic looking
		like procedural, Coral8 and StreamBase do the procedural logic looking
		like relational, and Triceps is a design of a language without a
		language. Eventually there probably will be a language, to be mixed
		with the parent one. But for now a lot can be done by simply using the
		Triceps library in an existing scripting language. The existing
		scripting languages are already powerful, fast, and also support the
		dynamic compilation.
		</p><p>
		No separate server executable, no need to control it, and no custom
		network protocols: the users can put the code directly into their
		executables and devise any protocols they please. Well, it's not a
		real good answer for the protocols, since it means that everyone who
		wants to communicate the streaming data for Triceps over the network
		has to implement these protocols from scratch. So eventually Triceps
		will provide a default implementation. But it doesn't have to be done
		right away.
		</p><p>
		No data persistence for now either. It's a nice feature, and I have
		some ideas about it too, but it requires a large amount of work, and
		doesn't really affect the API. 
		</p><p>
		The language used to implement Triceps is C++, and the scripting
		language is Perl. Nothing really prevents embedding Triceps into other
		languages but it's not going to happen anywhere soon. The reason being
		that extra code adds weight and makes the changes more difficult.
		</p><p>
		The multithreading support has been a major consideration from the
		start. All the C++ code has been written with the multithreading in
		mind. However for the first release the multithreading did not
		propagate into the Perl API yet.
		</p><p>
		Even though Triceps is a system aimed for quick experimentation, that does not imply
		that it's of a toy quality. The code is written in production quality
		to start with, with a full array of unit tests. In fact, the only way
		you can do the quick experimentation is by setting up the proper
		testing from the scratch. The idea of <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">move fast and break
		things</span>&#8221;</span> is complete rubbish.
