Things that need to be done:
* redo the errors to confess
* go through the docs and add all the issues mentioned there to here
* doc: describe the option to make die() work as confess()
* doc: the aggregation with helper tables has an issue: how to tell that it's the last DELETE?
* more features for the SimpleAggregator
* in RowHandle add getTable()
* add the row contents access methods directly on a row handle?
* in Row add the array index argument in get()
* identify a group for iteration by the pair (parent index type, leaf index type)
* groupSize() outside of the aggregator context
* iteration backwards
* an encapsulation of iteration range: begin, end, direction, maybe level of the step
* add $unit->makeLabelFrom() - a computational block with input and output labels,
  input chained from another label
* add $label->relabelRowop()
* add option fromLabel throughout templates
