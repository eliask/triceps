Things that need to be done:
* redo the errors to confess
* go through the docs and add all the issues mentioned there to here
* doc: the aggregation with helper tables has an issue: how to tell that it's the last DELETE?
* finish the SimpleAggregator
* doc: explain why sending the timestamps from the master is the right synchronization
* in joins separate the feed stream and table look-ups, for time-limited propagation
