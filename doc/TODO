Things that need to be done:
* redo the errors to confess
* go through the docs and add all the issues mentioned there to here
* doc: describe the option to make die() work as confess()
* doc: the aggregation with helper tables has an issue: how to tell that it's the last DELETE?
* more features for the SimpleAggregator
* in RowHandle add getTable()
* add the row contents access methods directly on a row handle?
* in Row add the array index argument in get()
* identify a group for iteration by the pair (parent index type, leaf index type)
* groupSize() outside of the aggregator context
* iteration backwards
* an encapsulation of iteration range: begin, end, direction, maybe level of the step
* add $unit->makeLabelFrom() - a computational block with input and output labels,
  input chained from another label
* add $label->relabelRowop() (adopt()?)
* add option fromLabel throughout templates
* change options to capitalized
* doc: Fields::, TableType::findIndexPath,findIndexKeyPath, Opt::checkMutuallyExclusive
* doc: JoinTwo key fields do have to have the same type, floating keys are bad
* in Table add a label for getting the modifications before they are applied
* in Table apply the modifications one by one and send through, add a catch for
  any attempted modifications in the middle of ongoing modifications
* in Labels mark busy when called, and confess on any attempts of recursive calls
* add a Sequence template, that calls its multiple output labels in order
* doc: an example of deletions in small portions (for selects, would need the
  mods in the tables to go one by one)
* a pseudo-table that keeps only the state of the additive aggregations, without actual data
  (the data just passes through and gets immediately aggregated)
