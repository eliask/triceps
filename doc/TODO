Things that need to be done:
* check the labels for belonging to a right unit when enqueueing?
* in Rowop construction replace asserts with exceptions
* redo the errors to confess
* change the typemap to confess
* remove the enqueueing mode in Rowops, and in Unit::enqueueDelayedTray(), and in table output
* more features for the SimpleAggregator
 ** standard deviation can be done in one pass
 ** median and percentiles on sorted indexes
 ** multi-stage functions
* keys() in ordered indexes
* index introspection: getOrder() (for each field A or D, or maybe 1 and -1, and 0 for un-ordered)
* in RowHandle add getTable()
* add the row contents access methods directly on a row handle?
* in Row add the array index argument in get(), a version of get by index
* add get() and friends directly on Rowop
* iteration backwards
* identify a group for iteration by the pair (parent index type, leaf index type)
* an encapsulation of iteration range: begin, end, direction, maybe level of the step, group
* add $unit->makeLabelFrom() - a computational block with input and output labels,
  input chained from another label
* add option fromLabel throughout templates
* change options to capitalized
* add a Sequence template, that calls its multiple output labels in order
* a pseudo-table that keeps only the state of the additive aggregations, without actual data
  (the data just passes through and gets immediately aggregated)
* convert everything to croak on errors (at least, the non-ignorable ones)
* option in labels, tracers etc. to not rethrow the Perl errors but just print them
* replace the exceptions with returning error bufs?
* replace all direct Perl_croak() with a smart stack unroll
* in Table, do something about collapsing empty groups on exception?
* in FIFO index, add options to match on exact or on first, or never match,
  and by default throw an exception
* snapshot queries in small portions (would need a comparison per key)
* should it throw from Unit::clearLabels(), and if called from a destructor, 
  catch it there?
* for basic persistence, add dump of tables, quick disconnect of results on reload
* register error messages from the outside scopes, to be printed on failure in the called functions
* in Tray handle the undefs and NULLs better (see XXX)
* rewrite makeLoop* with a Loop object
* make the Perl tracer with row contents a standard Triceps object
* support the row printing in Unit::Tracer in Perl similar to C++
* in Perl move the print() and such to the base tracer
* add the Perl interface for Errors?
* in the C++-underlying-Perl objects have a place to keep $self,
  with $obj->getSelf()->{CLASS} containing the blessing.
* when printing table types and such, make sure to \-escape the funny characters
* in Triceps::Fields::makeTranslation take the filter specs as arguments, and the caller's name
* in Type add a generic checkOrThrow(), maybe a template for initializeOrThrow()?
* in Type::Fields add parsing of the type names including the array indicators
* add the "distclean" to include the cleaning of docs
* in Types: make initialize() return an Onceref, make initializeOrThrow() and
  checkOrThrow() templates. In RowSetType change freeze() to initialize().
* instead of giving names to aggregator types themselves, give them names
  inside a table (like to indexes)
* initialize aggregators after all the indexes have been initialized
* examples for streaming functions: RIC/SEDOL/ISIN lookup,
  a TCP implementation?, queries from multiple sources, then filtering,
  join results (iterating over results of LookupJoin),
  queue with multiple readers; in Collapse group the deletes with inserts
  by forking a delete row to an insert table on flush
* Expand pattern: when the result of a join contains everything from the left
  side plus some from the right side, there is no need to keep the original
  pre-join left side (and the join result table can be used to generate the
  correct updates to send into the left side of the joib)
* for rows containing token-value pairs (array of token names, array of values),
  an index on tokens.
* make the Aggregator object optional, with NULL used in case if it's
  not needed (and could save an spot in GroupHandle too). Call the method
  handle() in the AggregatorType. BasicAggregator doesn't need gadget_.
* in JoinTwo require that only the input labels are of the same unit,
  tables may be different unit
* aggregation: add an option for mandatory keeping of the last row,
  and a way to find and iterate them (thus avoiding a separate table)
* in Perl FnReturn add the argument
  handler, and pass the args directly in push(), like [$fbind, @args...].
* A more strict handling of frame marks?
* add table dumping by condition
* add callAsChained in Perl
* in FnReturn add an option to act as a local nexus
* in JoinTwo add a mode that would allow to compute the initial join of two
  pre-existing tables, then disable thsi mode and continue with the subscription
* add an override of the printed label name in print(), printP() and code 
  that constructs labels around it
* in BasicAggregator add a storage for one previous result row (or make a separate
  type with it)
* export the AggregatorType::setRowType() to Perl initialization
* transient thread: after it exits, delete it and its nexuses
* adopt a nexus from another app, for inter-app communication
* when a thread in a fragment aborts, shut down and abort only that fragment
* get rid of periods at the end of error messages
* support arbitrary Perl interruptors for the threads
* a structured option-based way to build a Table
* a structured option-based way to build a Label (or maybe better a Compute
  element with an input and output Label)
* generalize a way to describe the building of a row type from other
  row types, like the joins do, to be shared by Joins and Compute
* maybe there is a point to import nexuses for neither reading nor writing,
  purely for type definitions (currently they are imported as writers)
* finish implementing Perl AggregatorType::make, setRowType, setConstructor, setHandler
* in all placess allow the source code snippets instead of the Perl function references
* T::Reflector - forwards all data from one nexus to another, a way to have a shared
  bus that is read-writable to all the threads; or maybe add a special case for
  importing a reverse facet for both reading and writing
* in TrieadOwner::nextXtray allow a timeout
* in ThreadedClient allow a timeout, and return 0 on expect on unexpected EOF
  or timeout
* a row type that also holds an arbitrary Perl value
* should the unit keep track of the tables? as-is it creates a reference loop,
  but think of some better way: maybe split the "table wrap", "table core" and
  input labeli(s). The table wrap will reference the unit, table core and input
  label. The core will reference all the output labels. The unit will reference
  the labels as usual and the table core.
* allow to assign a name to the computed key of an index, and have getkey()
  return both the assigned name and the source fields from which it is computed;
  allow to select the index for joins by that assigned name (and the source
  fields still would have to be provided from the other side of the join
  to compute the index value); the assigned name must not conflict with the
  field names of the row type

App ideas:
* queries on CSV files - already done in DBD::CSV?
* distributed cron
* data cache
