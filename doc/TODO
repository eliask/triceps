Things that need to be done:
* redo the errors to confess
* go through the docs and add all the issues mentioned there to here
* more features for the SimpleAggregator
* in RowHandle add getTable()
* add the row contents access methods directly on a row handle?
* in Row add the array index argument in get()
* identify a group for iteration by the pair (parent index type, leaf index type)
* groupSize() outside of the aggregator context
* iteration backwards
* an encapsulation of iteration range: begin, end, direction, maybe level of the step
* add $unit->makeLabelFrom() - a computational block with input and output labels,
  input chained from another label
* add option fromLabel throughout templates
* change options to capitalized
* add a Sequence template, that calls its multiple output labels in order
* a pseudo-table that keeps only the state of the additive aggregations, without actual data
  (the data just passes through and gets immediately aggregated)
* convert everything to croak on errors (at least, the non-ignorable ones)
* option in labels, tracers etc. to not rethrow the Perl errors but just print them
* replace the exceptions with returning error bufs?
* replace all direct Perl_croak() with a smart stack unroll
* in Table, do something about collapsing empty groups on exception?

* doc: describe the option to make die() work as confess()
* doc: the aggregation with helper tables has an issue: how to tell that it's the last DELETE?
* doc: Fields::, TableType::findIndexPath,findIndexKeyPath, Opt::checkMutuallyExclusive
* doc: JoinTwo floating keys are bad
* doc: an example of deletions in small portions (for selects, would need the
  mods in the tables to go one by one)
* doc: Label->hasChained()
* doc: Label->adopt()
* doc: croaking in Unit, propagation of errors from label execution
* doc: propagation of errors clears the scheduler stack, leaves a fairly inconsistent state
* doc: aggregator "before" is now called before the mods;
  update the examples from xTrafficAgg in the final docs
* doc: table ".pre", groupSizeIdx()
* doc: hidden options of LookupJoin
