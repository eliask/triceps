Developer's Guide on Kindle

By the way, if you want to read the Developer's Guide on Kindle, you can get it directly from Amazon for their minimal price of $1:

Or I think it should be available in the Kindle library too, if you are subscribed to it. Or of course you can just download the official PDF or HTML for free.
