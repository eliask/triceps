even more stuff for 1.0

I've added the function Triceps::Fields::makeTranslation() that makes the output field filtering and renaming, similar to the one in joins, easy to insert into the random user-defined templates. Again, look in the upcoming docs, the chapter on templates for the description.

The build instructions have been completely rewritten and greatly clarified. The build configuration settings became easier too.

The Table methods for row finding and iteration now confess on errors, since checking their error codes otherwise is completely impractical.

A lot more methods have been converted to the new-style error handling, with confessing on errors.
