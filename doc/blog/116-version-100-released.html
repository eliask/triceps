Version 1.0.0 released

Woohoo! The version 1.0.0 is officially released!

The download links are at the project web page http://triceps.sourceforge.net/ which had also gotten some refreshment.

Writing the manual took a long time but it ended up quite nice, big and detailed. It has about the same size as my book.
