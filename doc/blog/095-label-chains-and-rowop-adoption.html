Label chains and Rowop adoption

Those are actually two separate operations I've added for the benefits of the joins.<br />
<br />
To check if there are any labels chained from this one, use:<br />
<br />
<pre>$result = $label-&gt;hasChained();
</pre>
<br />
The same check can be done with<br />
<br />
<pre>@chain = $label-&gt;getChain();

if ($#chain &gt;= 0) { ... }
</pre>
<br />
but the hasChained() is more efficient since it doesn't have to construct that intermediate array.<br />
<br />
The adoption is a way to pass the row and opcode from one rowop to another new one, with a different label:<br />
<br />
<pre>$rowop2 = $label-&gt;adopt($rowop1);
</pre>
<br />
Very convenient for building the label handlers that pass the rowops to the other labels unchanged. It also can be done with<br />
<br />
<pre>$rowop2 = $label-&gt;makeRowop($rowop1-&gt;getOpcode(), $rowop1-&gt;getRow());
</pre>
<br />
But adopt() is easier to call and also more efficient, because less of the intermediate data surfaces from the C++ level to the Perl level. A more extended usage example will be shown momentarily.<br />
<br />
