performance variations

I've had an opportunity to run the performance tests on a few more laptops. Al of the same Core2 generation, but with the different CPU frequencies. The 2GHz version showed expectedly an about 10% lower performance, except for the inter-thread communication through the nexus: it went up. On a 3GHz CPU all the performance went up about proportionally. So I'm not sure, what was up with the 2.2GHz CPU, maybe the timing worked out just wrong to add more overhead.

Here are the result from a 3GHz CPU:

  Excluding makeRowArray 29.603730 s, 3377.95 per second.
Table lookup (single hashed idx) 0.287407 s, 347938.44 per second.
Table lookup (single sorted idx) 9.160540 s, 10916.39 per second.

Nexus pass (1 row/flush) 0.618648 s, 161642.86 per second.
Nexus pass (10 rows/flush) 2.417818 s, 413596.01 per second.

I've added a few more tests: the table look-ups, and the passing of rows through the nexus with 10 rows per batch. With the batching, the inter-thread communications work quite decently fast.
