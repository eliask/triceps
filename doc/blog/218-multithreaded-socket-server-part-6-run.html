Multithreaded socket server, part 6, a run example

Hare is a protocol from a run. It has been produced with the automated testing infrastructure that I'll describe later.

As usual, the lines sent from the clients to the socket server are preceded with a "> ". But since there are many clients, to tell them apart, both the sent and received lines are prefixed by the client's name and a "|". I've just picked arbitrary client names to tell them apart.

I've also marked the incoming connection as "> connect client_name", and the disconnections as "__EOF__" after the client name.

So, here we go.

 > connect c1
c1|!ready,cliconn1
> connect c2
c2|!ready,cliconn2

Two clients connect.

 > c1|publish,*,zzzzzz
c1|*,zzzzzz
c2|*,zzzzzz

A message published to the topic "*" gets forwarded to all the connected clients. In reality the messages may of course be received on separate sockets in any order, but I've ordered them here for the ease of reading.

> c2|garbage,trash
c2|!invalid command,garbage,trash

An invalid command gets detected in the writer thread and responded as such.

> c2|subscribe,A
c2|!subscribed,A
> c1|publish,A,xxx
c2|A,xxx

A subscription request gets acknowledged, and after that all the messages sent to this topic get received by the client.

> c1|subscribe,A
c1|!subscribed,A
> c1|publish,A,www
c1|A,www
c2|A,www

If more than one client is subscribed to a topic, all of them get the messages.

> c2|unsubscribe,A
c2|!unsubscribed,A
> c1|publish,A,vvv
c1|A,vvv

The unsubscription makes the client stop receiving messages from this topic.

> connect c3
c3|!ready,cliconn3
> c3|exit
c3|!exiting
c3|__EOF__

The third client connects, immediately requests an exit, gets the confirmation and gets disconnected.

> connect c4
c4|!ready,cliconn4
> close WR c4
c4|!exiting
c4|__EOF__

The fourth client connects and then closes its write side of the socket (that is the read side for the server). It produces the same affect as the exit command.

> c1|shutdown
c1|*,server shutting down
c1|__EOF__
c2|*,server shutting down
c2|__EOF__

And the shutdown command sends the notifications to all the remaining clients and closes the connections.
