The dreaded diamond and insert-only updates

The second problem with the diamond topology (see the diagram in the previous post) happens when the blocks B and C keep the state, and the input data gets updated by simply re-sending a record with the same key. This kind of updates is typical for the systems that do not have the concept of opcodes.

Consider a CCL example (approximate, since I can't test it) that gets the securities borrow and loan event reports, differentiated by the sign of the quantity, and sums up the borrows and loans separately:

<pre>create schema s_A (
&nbsp; id integer, 
&nbsp; symbol string,
&nbsp; quantity long
);
create input stream i_A schema s_A;

create schema s_D (
&nbsp; symbol string,
&nbsp; borrowed boolean, // flag: loaned or borrowed
&nbsp; quantity long
);
create public window w_D schema s_D
keep last per symbol, borrowed;

create public window w_B schema s_A keep last per id;
create public window w_C schema s_A keep last per id;

insert when quantity &lt; 0
  then w_B
  else w_C
select * from i_A; 

insert into w_D
select
&nbsp; symbol,
&nbsp; true,
&nbsp; sum(quantity)
group by symbol
from w_B;

insert into w_D
select
&nbsp; symbol,
&nbsp; false,
&nbsp; sum(quantity)
group by symbol 
from w_C;
</pre>

It works OK until a row with the same id gets updated to a different sign of quantity:

<pre>1,AAA,100
....
1,AAA,-100
</pre>

If the quantity kept the same sign, the new row would simply replace the old one in w_B or w_C, and the aggregation result would be right again. But when the sign changes, the new row goes into a different direction than the previous one. Now it ends up with both w_B and w_C having rows with the same id: one old and one new!

In this case really the problem is at the "fork" part of the "diamond", the merging part of it is just along for the ride, carrying the incorrect results.

This problem does not happen in the systems that have both inserts and deletes. Then the data sequence becomes

<pre>INSERT,1,AAA,100
....
DELETE,1,AAA,100
INSERT,1,AAA,-100
</pre>

The DELETE goes along the same branch as the first insert and undoes its effect, then the second INSERT goes into the other branch.

Since Triceps has both INSERT and DELETE opcodes, it's immune to this problem, as long as the input data has the correct DELETEs in it.

If you wonder, the CCL example can be fixed too but in a more round-about way, by adding a couple of statements before the "insert-when" statement:

<pre>on w_A
delete from w_B
  where w_A.id = w_B.id;

on w_A
delete from w_C
  where w_A.id = w_C.id;
</pre>

This generates the matching deletes. Of course, if you want, you can use this way with Triceps too.
