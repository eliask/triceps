Rhref constructor directly from fields

I've been writing more C++ unit tests, and I've come up with one more convenience constructor for Rhref:

Rhref(Table *t, FdataVec &data);

It takes directly the field values, constructs a row out of them, then constructs a handle for that row.

The usage is pretty easy:

Rhref rh1(t, dv);
