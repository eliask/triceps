A snapshot pre-release of 1.1.0

Now the Streaming Functions look wrapped up, and before embarking on the next big feature, it looks like a good time to publish a snapshot. This one is named 1.0.91-20121129, and is available for download now.

As usual with the snapshots, the Developer's Guide in the package has not been updated, instead this blog serves as the interim documentation. The posts with the label 1_1_0 up to now describe all the new features.
