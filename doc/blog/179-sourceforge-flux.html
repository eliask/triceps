SourceForge flux

SourceForge has been insisting on the conversion of the project to their new engine, and I've finally given in. This means that the SVN repository location has changed, and the links there don't work any more. I'll update them shortly. And if you've checked out the code from SVN, you'd need to re-do it from the new location.
