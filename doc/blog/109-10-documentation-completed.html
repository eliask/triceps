1.0 documentation completed

This concludes the documentation for the version 1.0. The C++ API hasn't been described yet, but it all has been taking way more time and effort than I've planned. Of course, the result is coming out better than I've planned too, both from the docs and from the features standpoint. Currently Triceps is at the state that I've planned more for the version 1.3 or so. But it keeps dragging, and at some point it's just time to draw the line. The C++ docs will have to wait until after the 1.0 release. I've had more ideas for the Perl examples as well, and they'll have to wait too.

Now I'm going to work on assembling and formatting the documentation nicely, and then producing the official release 1.0.
