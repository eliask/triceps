Some trivia about table's labels

I'm not sure whether I've made it clear before, but I want to drive one point home: the table's output label propagates all the changes done to the table. How the changes were made, through a rowop on the input label, or through the procedural calls, doesn't matter. All of them will always come to the output label.

Incidentally, the table's labels do have the symbolic names. They are produced from the table name by adding a dot and "in" or "out". The table named "table" will have the labels "table.in" and "table.out".

That's pretty much the Triceps convention: use the dotted notation to name the objects that belong to the internals of the other objects.
