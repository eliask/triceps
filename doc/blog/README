A copy of posts from the blog.

It started by collecting them in the HTML source format, but then
the HTML stuff has proved itself useless for the final Docbook formatting
and also the reason for text corruption: I would edit some fragment
in raw HTML, make a small error somewhere, and when saving, the blog
software would just throw away the piece of text with the error.
So I gave up on HTML, but historically the files here are still named
with the .html suffix.
