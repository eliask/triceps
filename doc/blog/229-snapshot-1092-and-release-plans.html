snapshot 1.0.92 and the release plans

I've released the new snapshot, 1.0.92, that contains all the most recent multithreading code. There is one more big example to go, and then the docs to be collected from the blog into the proper manual (and a bunch of them to be written yet), but other than that it's pretty much a preview of the next release.

Speaking of which, it has been clear for a while that the next release has overgrown the 1.1 designation. I should have done a couple intermediate releases but the multithreading looks like a very important feature, and I've been pushing towards that.

Hereby I officially proclaim that the next release will be 2.0, and in honor of that all the future blog posts about it will be tagged 2_0.
