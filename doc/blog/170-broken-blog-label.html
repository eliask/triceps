broken blog label

I've found out that the label "c++" doesn't work correctly. Weird thing, it does work on the post list in the blog editing mode, but not in the blog reader. I guess, the handling of the non-word characters got screwed up somewhere in the reader.

To work around this issue, I'll be using the label "cpp" instead from now on.
