debugging

I've recently attended a training on debugging on Windows (pretty good one, by Wintellect, if you're interested). And all along I've been impressed how the features of WinDbg are similar to the features I wrote back at Aleri into the debugger for the Aleri CEP virtual machine. (Okay, gdb is probably similar too but I've never learned it in depth, I've never been a big fan of debuggers). I guess the fundamentals of debugging are the same, no matter what is the platform. Only I also wrote into it a way to go backwards and backtrace after hitting a breakpoint, what led to the current situation.
