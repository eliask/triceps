Self-join done manually 

As I've mentioned before, in many cases the self-joins are better suited to be done by the manual looping through the data. This is especially true if the table represents a tree, linked by the parent-child node id and the processing has to navigate through the tree. Indeed, if the tree may be of an arbitrary depth, there is no way to handle if with the common joins, you will need just an arbitrary number of joins (through there are some SQL extensions for the recursive self- joins).<br />
<br />
The arbitration example can also be conveniently rewritten through the manual loops. The input row type, table type, table, unit, and the main loop do not change, so I won't copy them the second time. The rest of the code is:<br />

Whenever a new rowop is processed in the table, it goes to the Compute label. The row in this rowop is the first leg of the triangle. The loop then finds all the possible second legs that can be connected to the first leg. And then for each second leg it checks whether it can make the third leg back to the original currency. If it can, good, we've found a candidate for a result row.<br />
<br />
The way the loops work, this time there is no triplication. But the same triangle still can be found starting from any of its three currencies. This means that to keep the data consistent, no matter what was the first currency in a particular run, it still must produce the exact some result row. To achieve that, the currencies get rotated as explained in the last post, making sure that the first currency is has the lexically smallest name. These if-else statements do that by selecting the direction of rotation (if any) and build the result record in one of three ways.<br />
<br />
Finally it compares the combined rate to 1, and if greater then sends the result. If not, a debugging printout starting with "__" prints the row, so that is can be seen. Another debugging printout prints the original order of the currencies, letting us check that the rotation was performed correctly.<br />
<br />
On feeding the same input data this code produces the result:<br />

It's the same result as before, only without the triplicates. And you can see that the rotation logic works right. The manual self-joining has produced the result without triplicates, without an intermediate table, and for me writing and understanding its logic is much easier than with the "proper" joins. I'd say that the manual self-join is a winner in every respect.<br />
<br />
An interesting thing is that this manual logic produces the same result independently of whether it's connected to the Output or Pre label of the table. Try changing it, it works the same. This is because the original row is taken directly from the input rowop, and never participates in the join again; it's never read from the table by any of the loops. If it were read again from the table by the loops, the connection order would matter. And the right one would be fairly weird: the INSERT rowops would have to be processed coming from the Output label, the DELETE rowops coming from the Pre label.<br />
<br />
This is because the row has to be in the table to be found. And for an INSERT the row gets there only after it goes through the table and comes out on the Output label. But for a DELETE the row would get already deleted from the table by that time. Instead it has to be handled before that, on the Pre label, when the table only prepares to delete it.<br />
<br />
If you look at the version with JoinTwo, that's also how an inner self-join works. Since it's an inner join, both rows on both sides must be present to produce a result. An INSERT first arrives from the Pre label on the left side, doesn't find itself in the table, and produces no result (again, we're talking here about the situation when a row has to get joined to itself; it might well find the other pairs for itself and produce a result for them but not for itself joined with itself). Then it arrives the second time from the Output label on the right side. Now it looks in the table, and finds itself, and produces the result (an INSERT coming form the join). A DELETE also first arrives from the Pre label on the left side. It finds its copy in the table and produces the result (a DELETE coming from the join). When the second copy of the row arrives from the Output label on the right side, it doesn't find its copy in the table any more, and produces nothing. In the end it's the same thing, an INSERT comes out of the join triggered by the table Output label, a DELETE comes out of the join triggered by the table Pre label. It's not a whimsy, it's caused by the requirements of the correctness. The manual self-join would have to mimic this order to produce the correct result.
