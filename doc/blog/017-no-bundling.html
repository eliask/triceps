No bundling

The most important principle of Triceps scheduling is: No Bundling. Every rowop is for itself. The bundling is what messes up the Coral8 scheduler the most. 


What is a bundle? It's a set of records that go through the execution together. If you have two functional elements F1 and F2 arranged in a sequential fashion F1-&gt; F2, and a few loose records R1, R2, R3, the normal execution order will be:


F1(R1), F2(R1),
F1(R2), F2(R2),
F1(R3), F2(R3)

If the same records are placed in a bundle, the execution order will be different:


F1(R1), F1(R2), F1(R3),
F2(R1), F2(R2), F2(R3)

That would not be a problem, and even could be occasionally useful, if the bundles were always created explicitly. In reality every time a statement produces multiple record from a single one (think of a join that picks multiple records from another side), it creates a bundle and messes up all the logic after it. Some logic gets affected so badly that a few statements in CCL (like ON UPDATE) had to be designated as always ignoring the bundles, otherwise they would not work at all. At DB I wrote a CCL pattern for breaking up the bundles. It's rather heavyweight and thus could not be used all over the place but provides a generic solution for the most unpleasant cases.

Worse yet, the bundles may get created in Coral8 absolutely accidentally: if two records happen to have the same timestamp, for all practical purposes they would act as a bundle. In models that were designed without the appropriate guards, this leads to the time-based bugs that are hard to catch and debug. Writing these guards correctly is hard, and testing them is even harder. 

Another issue with bundles is that they make the large queries slower. Suppose you do a query from a window that returns a million records.&nbsp; All of them will be collected in a bundle, then the bundle will be sent to the interface gateway that would build one huge protocol packet, which will then be sent to the client, which will receive the whole packet and then finally iterate on the records in it. Assuming that nothing runs out of memory along the way, it will be a long time until the client sees the first record.&nbsp; Very, very annoying.

Aleri also has its own version of bundles, called transactions, but a more smart one. Aleri always relies on the primary keys. The condition for a transaction is that it must never contain multiple modification for the same primary key. Since there are no execution order guarantees between the functional elements, in this respect the transactions work in the same way as loose records, only with a more efficient communication between threads. Still, if the primary key changes in an element, the condition does not propagate through it. Such elements have to internally collapse the outgoing transactions along the new key, adding overhead.
