SourceForge flux completed

The SourceForge conversion has completed, and I've updated the source code repository links on the web page. I'm not exactly sure, why did they require this conversion. Okay, the svn+ssh access method to SVN is slightly more convenient, but the SVN browser seems to have become worse, and the other project functionality seems to have become slightly worse too.
