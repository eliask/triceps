Triceps now on CPAN, release 1.0.1

I've finally got around to upload Triceps to CPAN. In process I've found that I didn't set the version for 1.0.0 right in the Perl files, so I've had to fix that. The result is the release 1.0.1.

There are no other changes, I didn't even backport the stuff for the easier configuration on the older GCC compilers.
