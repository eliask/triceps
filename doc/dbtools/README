Put the docbook tools from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/triceps/files/docbook-for-1.0/ 
here.  Run "make" to extract them.  They are not a part of
the basic distribution, to keep the Triceps package smaller and the packages
separate. Besides, they're expected to stay the same for a long while.
