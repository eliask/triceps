# The use of immediate import.
Thread A creates the nexus O;
Thread A creates the helper thread B and tells it to import the nexus A/O for its input immediately and create the reverse nexus R for result;
Thread A requests a (normal) import of the nexus B/R and falls asleep because B is not constructed yet;
	Thread B starts running;
	Thread B imports the nexus A/O immediately and succeeds;
	Thread B defines its result nexus R;
	Thread B marks itself as constructed and ready;
Thread A wakes up after B is constructed, finds the nexus B/R and completes its import;
Thread A can then complete its initialization, export other nexuses etc.
