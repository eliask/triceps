		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The joins are quite important for the relational data processing, and
		come in many varieties. And the CEP systems have their own specifics.
		Basically, in CEP you want the joins to be processed fast. The CEP
		systems deal with the changing model state, and have to process these
		changes incrementally.
		</para>

		<para>
		A small change should be handled fast. It has to use the indexes to
		find and update all the related result rows. Even though you can make
		it just go sequentially through all the rows and find the relevant
		ones, like in a common database, that's not what you normally want.
		When something like this happens, the usual reaction is <quote>wtf is my
		model suddenly so slow?</quote> following by an annoyingly long investigation
		into the reasons of the slowness, and then rewriting the model to make
		it work faster. It's better to just prevent the slowness in the first
		place and make sure that the joins always use an index. And since you
		don't have to deal much with the ad-hoc queries when you write a CEP
		model, you can provide all the needed indexes in advance very easily.
		</para>

			<secondary>equi-join</secondary>

		</indexterm>
		<para>
		A particularly interesting kind of joins in this regard is the
		equi-joins: ones that join the rows by the equality of the fields in
		them. They allow a very efficient index look-up. Because of this, they
		are popular in the CEP world. Some systems, like Aleri, support only
		the equi-joins to start with. The other systems are much more efficient
		on the equi-joins than on the other kinds of joins. At the moment
		Triceps follows the fashion of having the advanced support only for the
		equi-joins. Even though the Sorted/Ordered indexes in Triceps should allow the
		range-based comparisons to be efficient too, at the moment there are no
		table methods for the look-up of ranges, they are left for the future
		work. Of course, nothing stops you from copying an equi-join template
		and modifying it to work by a dumb iteration. Just it would be slow,
		and I didn't see much point in it.
		</para>

		<para>
		There also are three common patterns of the join usage.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>Coral8</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>lookup</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>stream-to-window</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		In the first pattern the rows sort of go by and get enriched by looking
		up some information from a table and tacking it onto these rows.
		Sometimes not even tacking it on but maybe just filtering the data:
		passing through some of the rows and throwing away the rest, or
		directing the rows into the different kinds of processing, based on the
		looked-up data. For a reference, in the Coral8 CCL this situation is
		called <quote>stream-to-window joins</quote>. In Triceps there are no streams and no
		windows, so I just call them the <quote>lookup joins</quote>.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>tables</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		In the second pattern multiple stateful tables are joined together.
		Whenever any of the tables changes, the join result also changes, and
		the updates get propagated through. This can be done through lookups,
		but in reality it turns out that defining manually the lookups for the
		every possible table change becomes tedious pretty quickly. This has to
		be addressed by the automation.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>self</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		In the third pattern the same table gets joined recursively,
		essentially traversing a representation of a tree stored in that table.
		This actually doesn't work well with the classic SQL unless the
		recursion depth is strictly limited. There are SQL extensions for the
		recursive self-joins in the modern databases but I haven't seen them in the
		CEP systems yet. Anyway, the procedural approach tends to work for this
		situation much better than the SQLy one, so the templates tend to be of
		not much help. I'll show a templated and a manual example of this kind
		for comparison.
		</para>

		<title>Hello, joins!</title>

		<para>
		As usual, let me show a couple of little teasers before starting the
		long bottom-up discussion. We'll eventually get by the long
		way to the same examples, so here I'll show only some very short
		code snippets and basic explanations.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupFull, replaced leftFields from commented-out, removed fieldsLeftFirst, isLeft -->

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>lookup</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		This is a lookup join that gets the incoming rows with transactions
		data from the label <pre>$lbTrans</pre>, finds the account translation in the
		table <pre>$tAccounts</pre>, and translates the external account representation
		to internal one on its output. The join condition is an equivalent of the
		SQLy

		<para>
		The condition looks up the rows in <pre>$tAccounts</pre> using the index <quote>lookupSrcExt</quote>
		that must have the key fields <pre>source</pre> and <pre>external</pre>.

		The result fields will contain all the fields from <pre>$lbTrans</pre> except those

		that becomes renamed to <pre>acct</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		Next goes a table join:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doJoinInner -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::JoinTwo->new(
	name => "join",
	leftTable => $tPosition,
	leftIdxPath => [ "currencyLookup" ],

</pre>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>tables</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		It joins the tables <pre>$tPosition</pre> and <pre>$tToUsd</pre>, with the inner join logic.
		The table <pre>$tPosition</pre> uses its index <quote>currencyLookup</quote>, and <pre>$tToUsd</pre> uses
		its index <quote>primary</quote>. The join condition is determined by pairing the
		key fields of the indexes.
		</para>
	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="sc_joins_lookup_manual">
		<title>The lookup join, done manually</title>

		<para>
		First let's look at a lookup done manually. It would also establish the
		baseline for the further joins.
		</para>

		<para>
		For the background of the model, let's consider the trade information
		coming in from multiple sources. Each source system has its own
		designation of the accounts on which the trades happen but ultimately
		they are the same accounts. So there is a table that contains the
		translation from the account designations of various external systems
		to our system's own internal account identifier. This gets described
		with the row types:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t -->
<pre>
our $rtInTrans = Triceps::RowType->new( # a transaction received
	id => "int32", # the transaction id
	acctSrc => "string", # external system that sent us a transaction
	acctXtrId => "string", # its name of the account of the transaction
	amount => "int32", # the amount of transaction (int is easier to check)
) or confess "$!";

our $rtAccounts = Triceps::RowType->new( # account translation map
	source => "string", # external system that sent us a transaction
	external => "string", # its name of the account in the transaction
	internal => "int32", # our internal account id
) or confess "$!";
</pre>

		<para>
		Other than those basics, the rest of information is only minimal, to
		keep the examples smaller. Even the trade ids are expected to be global
		and not per the source systems (which is not realistic but saves
		another little bit of work).
		</para>

		<para>
		The accounts table can be indexed in multiple ways for multiple
		purposes, say:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t -->
<pre>
our $ttAccounts = Triceps::TableType->new($rtAccounts)
	->addSubIndex("lookupSrcExt", # quick look-up by source and external id
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "source", "external" ])
	)
	->addSubIndex("iterateSrc", # for iteration in order grouped by source
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "source" ])
		->addSubIndex("iterateSrcExt", 
			Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "external" ])
		)
	)
	->addSubIndex("lookupIntGroup", # quick look-up by internal id (to multiple externals)
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "internal" ])
		->addSubIndex("lookupInt", Triceps::IndexType->newFifo())
	)
or confess "$!";
$ttAccounts->initialize() or confess "$!";
</pre>

		<para>
		For our purpose of joining, the first, primary key is the way to go.
		Using the primary key also has the advantage of making sure that there
		is no more than one row for each key value.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>manual lookup</secondary>
		</indexterm>

		</indexterm>

			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>lookup</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The first manual lookup example will just do the filtering: find, whether there is a match
		in the translation table, and if so then pass the row through. The
		example goes as follows:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doManualLookup -->
<pre>
our $uJoin = Triceps::Unit->new("uJoin");

our $tAccounts = $uJoin->makeTable($ttAccounts, 
	"EM_CALL", "tAccounts") or confess "$!";

my $lbFilterResult = $uJoin->makeDummyLabel($rtInTrans, "lbFilterResult");
my $lbFilter = $uJoin->makeLabel($rtInTrans, "lbFilter", undef, sub {
	my ($label, $rowop) = @_;
	my $row = $rowop->getRow();
	my $rh = $tAccounts->findBy(
		source => $row->get("acctSrc"),
		external => $row->get("acctXtrId"),
	);
	if (!$rh->isNull()) {
		$uJoin->call($lbFilterResult->adopt($rowop));
	}
}) or confess "$!";

# label to print the changes to the detailed stats
makePrintLabel("lbPrint", $lbFilterResult);

while(&readLine) {
	chomp;
	my @data = split(/,/); # starts with a command, then string opcode
	my $type = shift @data;
	if ($type eq "acct") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($tAccounts->getInputLabel(), @data);
	} elsif ($type eq "trans") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($lbFilter, @data);
	}
	$uJoin->drainFrame(); # just in case, for completeness
}
</pre>

		<para>
		The <pre>findBy()</pre> is where the join actually happens: the lookup of the data
		in a table by values from another row. Very similar to what the
		basic window example in
		<xref linkend="sc_table_hello" xrefstyle="select: label quotedtitle pageabbrev"/>&xrsp;
		was doing before. It's <pre>findBy()</pre>, without the need for <pre>findByIdx()</pre>,
		because in this case the index type used in the accounts table is its
		first leaf index, to which <pre>findBy()</pre> defaults.
		After that the fact of
		successful or unsuccessful lookup is used to pass the original row
		through or throw it away. If the found row were used to pick some
		fields from it and stick them into the result, that would be a more
		complete join, more like what you often expect to see.
		</para>

		<para>
		And here is an example of the input processing:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doManualLookup -->
<exdump>
> acct,OP_INSERT,source1,999,1
> acct,OP_INSERT,source1,2011,2
> acct,OP_INSERT,source2,ABCD,1
> trans,OP_INSERT,1,source1,999,100
lbFilterResult OP_INSERT id="1" acctSrc="source1" acctXtrId="999" amount="100" 
> trans,OP_INSERT,2,source2,ABCD,200
lbFilterResult OP_INSERT id="2" acctSrc="source2" acctXtrId="ABCD" amount="200" 
> trans,OP_INSERT,3,source2,QWERTY,200
> acct,OP_INSERT,source2,QWERTY,2
> trans,OP_DELETE,3,source2,QWERTY,200
lbFilterResult OP_DELETE id="3" acctSrc="source2" acctXtrId="QWERTY" amount="200" 
> acct,OP_DELETE,source1,999,1
</exdump>

		<para>
		It starts with populating the accounts table. Then the transactions that
		find the match pass, and those who don't find don't pass. If more of
		the account translations get added later, the transactions for them
		start passing but as you can see, the result might be slightly
		unexpected: you may get a DELETE that had no matching previous INSERT,
		as happened for the row with id=3.
		This happens because the lookup join keeps no history on its left side
		and can't react properly to the changes to the table on the right.
		Because of this, the lookup joins work best when the reference table
		gets pre-populated in advance and then stays stable.
		</para>

		When a join has to produce the new rows, with the data from both the
		incoming row and the ones looked up in the reference table, this can
		also be done manually but may be more convenient to do with the
		LookupJoin template. The translation of account to the internal ids can
		be done like this:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupLeft, removed saveJoinerTo -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::LookupJoin->new(
	unit => $uJoin,

	} elsif ($type eq "trans") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($join->getInputLabel(), @data);
	}
	$uJoin->drainFrame(); # just in case, for completeness
}
</pre>

		<para>
		The join gets defined in the option name-value format. The options <quote>unit</quote> and
		<quote>name</quote> are as usual.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>left outer</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The incoming rows are always on the left side, the table on the right.
		LookupJoin can do either the inner join or the left outer join (since
		it does not react to the changes of the right table and has no access
		to the past data from the left side, the full and right outer joins are not
		available).
		In this case the option <quote>isLeft => 1</quote> selects the left outer join.
		The left outer join also happens to be the default if this option is not used.
		</para>

		<para>
		The left side is described by the option <quote>leftRowType</quote>, and causes the join's input
		label of this row type to be created. The input label can be found with
		<pre>$join->getInputLabel()</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		The right side is a table, specified in the option <quote>rightTable</quote>. The
		lookups in the table are done using a combination of an index and the
		field pairing. The option <quote>by</quote> provides the field pairing. It contains
		the pairs of field names, one from the left, and one from the right,
		for the equal fields. They can be separated by 
		<quote><pre>,</pre></quote> too, but <quote><pre>=></pre></quote>
		feels more idiomatic to me. These fields from the left are translated
		to the right and are used for lookup through the index. The index
		is specified with the path in the option <quote>rightIdxPath</quote>. If this
		option is missing, LookupJoin will just try to find the first top-level
		Hashed index. Either way, the index must be a Hashed index.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>index</primary>
			<secondary>hashed</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>index</primary>
			<secondary>sorted</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>LookupJoin</primary>
			<secondary>keys</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		There is no particular reason for it not being a Sorted/Ordered index, other
		that the <pre>getKey()</pre> call does not work for these indexes yet, and
		that's what the LookupJoin uses to check that the right-side index key
		matches the join key in <quote>by</quote>. The order of the fields in the
		option <quote>by</quote> and in the index may vary but the set of the
		fields must be the same.
		</para>

		<para>
		The index may be either a leaf (as in this example) or non-leaf. If
		it's a leaf, it could look up no more than one row per key, and
		LookupJoin uses this internally for a little optimization. Otherwise
		LookupJoin is capable of producing multiple result rows for one input row.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>projection</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>result filtering</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Finally, there is the result row. It is built out of the two original
		rows by picking the fields according to the options <quote>leftFields</quote> and
		<quote>rightFields</quote>. If either option is missing, that means 
		<quote>take all the fields</quote>. 
		The format of these options is from <pre>Triceps::Fields::filterToPairs()</pre>
		that has been described in
		<xref linkend="sc_template_result" xrefstyle="select: label quotedtitle pageabbrev"/>&xrsp;.
		So in this example <pre>[ "internal/acct" ]</pre> means: pass the field <pre>internal</pre>
		but rename it to <pre>acct</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		Remember that the field names in the result must not
		duplicate. It would be an error. So if the duplications happen, use the
		substitution syntax to rename some of the fields.
		</para>

		<para>
		A fairly common usage in joins is to just give the unique prefixes to
		the left-side and right-side fields. This can be achieved with:
		</para>

<pre>
	leftFields => [ '.*/left_$&' ],
	rightFields => [ '.*/right_$&' ],
</pre>

		<para>
		The <pre>$&</pre> in the substitution gets replaced with the whole matched
		field name.
		</para>

		<para>
		The option <quote>fieldsLeftFirst</quote> determines, which side will go first in
		the result. By default it's set to 1 (as in this example), and the left
		side goes first. If set to 0, the right side would go first.
		</para>

		<para>
		This setup for the result row types is somewhat clumsy but it's a
		reasonable first attempt. 
		</para>

		<para>
		Now, having gone through the description, an example of how it works:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupLeft -->
<exdump>
> acct,OP_INSERT,source1,999,1
> acct,OP_INSERT,source1,2011,2
> acct,OP_INSERT,source2,ABCD,1
> trans,OP_INSERT,1,source1,999,100
join.out OP_INSERT id="1" acctSrc="source1" acctXtrId="999" amount="100" acct="1" 
> trans,OP_INSERT,2,source2,ABCD,200
join.out OP_INSERT id="2" acctSrc="source2" acctXtrId="ABCD" amount="200" acct="1" 
> trans,OP_INSERT,3,source2,QWERTY,200
join.out OP_INSERT id="3" acctSrc="source2" acctXtrId="QWERTY" amount="200" 
> acct,OP_INSERT,source2,QWERTY,2
> trans,OP_DELETE,3,source2,QWERTY,200
join.out OP_DELETE id="3" acctSrc="source2" acctXtrId="QWERTY" amount="200" acct="2" 
> acct,OP_DELETE,source1,999,1
</exdump>

		<para>
		Same as before, first the accounts table gets populated, then the
		transactions are sent. If an account is not found, this left outer join
		still passes through the original fields from the left side. Adding an
		account later doesn't help the rowops that already went through but the
		new rowops will see it. The same goes for deleting an account, it
		doesn't affect the past rowops either.
		</para>

		<para>
		The left-side data can also be specified in another way: the option
		<quote>leftFromLabel</quote> provides a label which in turn provides both the input
		row type and the unit. You can still specify the unit option as well
		but it must match the one in the label. This is driven internally by
		<pre>Triceps::Opt::handleUnitTypeLabel()</pre>, described in
		<xref linkend="sc_template_options" xrefstyle="select: label quotedtitle pageabbrev"/>&xrsp;,
		so it follows the same rules.
		The join still has its own
		input label but it gets automatically chained to the one in the option.
		For an example of such a join:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupFull, removed commented-out stuff -->
<pre>
our $lbTrans = $uJoin->makeDummyLabel($rtInTrans, "lbTrans");

our $join = Triceps::LookupJoin->new(

	leftFromLabel => $lbTrans,
	rightTable => $tAccounts,
	rightIdxPath => ["lookupSrcExt"],
	leftFields => [ "id", "amount" ],
	fieldsLeftFirst => 0,
	rightFields => [ "internal/acct" ],
	by => [ "acctSrc" => "source", "acctXtrId" => "external" ],
	isLeft => 0,
); # would confess by itself on an error

# label to print the changes to the detailed stats
makePrintLabel("lbPrint", $join->getOutputLabel());

	my $type = shift @data;
	if ($type eq "acct") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($tAccounts->getInputLabel(), @data);
	} elsif ($type eq "trans") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($lbTrans, @data);
	}
	$uJoin->drainFrame(); # just in case, for completeness
}
</pre>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>inner</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The other options demonstrate the possibilities described in the last
		post. This time it's an inner join, the result has the right-side
		fields going first, and the left-side fields are filtered in the
		result by an explicit list of fields to pass.
		</para>

		<para>
		Another way to achieve the same filtering of the left-side fields would
		be by throwing away everything starting with <quote>acct</quote> and passing through
		the rest:
		</para>

<pre>
	leftFields => [ "!acct.*", ".*" ],
</pre>

		<para>
		And here is an example of a run:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupFull -->
<exdump>
> acct,OP_INSERT,source1,999,1
> acct,OP_INSERT,source1,2011,2
> acct,OP_INSERT,source2,ABCD,1
> trans,OP_INSERT,1,source1,999,100
join.out OP_INSERT acct="1" id="1" amount="100" 
> trans,OP_INSERT,2,source2,ABCD,200
join.out OP_INSERT acct="1" id="2" amount="200" 
> trans,OP_INSERT,3,source2,QWERTY,200
> acct,OP_INSERT,source2,QWERTY,2
> trans,OP_DELETE,3,source2,QWERTY,200
join.out OP_DELETE acct="2" id="3" amount="200" 
> acct,OP_DELETE,source1,999,1
</exdump>

		<para>
		The input data is the same as the last time, but the result is
		different. Since it's an inner join, the rows that don't find a match
		don't pass through. And of course the fields are ordered and subsetted
		differently in the result.
		</para>

		<para>
		The next example loses all connection with reality, it just serves to
		demonstrate another ability of LookupJoin: matching multiple rows on
		the right side for an incoming row. The situation itself is obviously
		useful and normal, just it's not what normally happens with the
		account id translation, and I was too lazy to invent another
		realistically-looking example.
		</para>

		<para>
		The main loop is unchanged from the first LookupJoin example, so I
		wont' copy it here. Just for something different, the join index here
		is nested, and its path consists of two elements. It's not a leaf index
		either, with one FIFO level under it. And when the <quote>isLeft</quote> is not
		specified explicitly, it defaults to 1, making it a left join.

		When a row matches multiple rows in the table, it gets multiplied. The
		join function iterates through the whole matching row group, and for
		each found row creates a result row and calls the output label with it.
		</para>

		<para>
		Now, what if you don't want to get multiple rows back even if they are
		found? Of course, the best way is to just use a leaf index. But once in
		a while you get into situations with the denormalized data in the
		lookup table. You might know in advance that for each row in an index
		group a certain field would be the same. Or you might not care, what
		exact value you get as long as it's from the right group. But you might
		really not want the input rows to multiply when they go through the
		join. LookupJoin has a solution:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupLeftMultiOne -->

	by => [ "acctSrc" => "source", "acctXtrId" => "external" ],
	limitOne => 1,
); # would confess by itself on an error
</pre>

		<para>
		The option <quote>limitOne</quote> changes the processing logic to pick only the
		first matching row. It also optimizes the join function. If <quote>limitOne</quote> is
		not specified explicitly, the join constructor deduces it magically by
		looking at whether the join index is a leaf or not. Actually, for a
		leaf index it would always override <quote>limitOne</quote> to 1, even if you
		explicitly set it to 0.
		</para>

		With the limit, the same input produces a different output:

		<para>
		Sometimes you might want to just get the list of the resulting rows
		from LookupJoin and iterate over them by yourself, rather than have it
		call the labels. To be honest, this looked kind of important when I
		wrote LookupJoin first, but by now I don't see a whole lot of use in
		it. By now, if you want to do a manual iteration, calling <pre>findBy()</pre> and
		then iterating looks like a more useful option. But at the time there
		was no <pre>findBy()</pre>, and this feature came to exist. Here is an example:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupLeftManual, removed saveJoinerTo -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::LookupJoin->new(
	unit => $uJoin,
	name => "join",
	leftRowType => $rtInTrans,
	rightTable => $tAccounts,
	rightIdxPath => ["lookupSrcExt"],

# label to print the changes to the detailed stats
my $lbPrint = makePrintLabel("lbPrint", $join->getOutputLabel());

while(&readLine) {
	chomp;
	my @data = split(/,/); # starts with a command, then string opcode
	my $type = shift @data;
	if ($type eq "acct") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($tAccounts->getInputLabel(), @data);
	} elsif ($type eq "trans") {
		my $op = shift @data; # drop the opcode field
		my $trans = $rtInTrans->makeRowArray(@data) or confess "$!";
		my @rows = $join->lookup($trans);
		foreach my $r (@rows) {
			$uJoin->call($lbPrint->makeRowop($op, $r)) or confess "$!";
		}
	}
	$uJoin->drainFrame(); # just in case, for completeness
}
</pre>

		<para>
		It copies the first LookupJoin example, only now with a manual iteration. Once the
		option <quote>automatic</quote> is set to 0 for the join, the method
		<pre>$join->lookup()</pre> becomes available to perform the lookup and return
		the result rows in an array (the data sent to the input label keeps
		working as usual, sending the result rows to the output label). This
		involves the extra overhead of keeping all the result rows (and there
		might be lots of them) in an array, so by default the join is compiled
		in an automatic-only mode.
		</para>

		<para>
		Since <pre>lookup()</pre> returns rows, not rowops, and knows nothing
		about the opcodes, those had to be handled separately around the lookup.
		</para>

		<para>
		The result is the same as for the first example, only the name of the
		result label differs:

		<para>
		The print label is still connected to the output label of the LookupJoin,
		but it's done purely for the convenience of its creation. Since no rowops
		get sent to the LookupJoin's input, none get to its output, and none
		get from there to the output label. Instead the main loop creates and sends the
		rowops directly to the output label when it iterates through the lookup
		results. Because of this the label name in the output is the name of
		the output label.

		<title>The key fields of LookupJoin</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>LookupJoin</primary>
			<secondary>keys</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The key fields are the ones that participate in the join condition.
		I use these terms interchangeably because by the definition of
		LookupJoin, these fields must be the key fields in the join index
		in the right-side table. LookupJoin has a few more facilities for their
		handling that haven't been shown yet.
		</para>

		<para>
		First, the join condition can be specified as the
		<pre>Triceps::Fields::filterToPairs()</pre> patterns in the option
		<quote>byLeft</quote>. The options <quote>by</quote> and
		<quote>byLeft</quote> are mutually exclusive and one of them
		must be present. The condition
		</para>

<pre>
by => [ "acctSrc" => "source", "acctXtrId" => "external" ],
</pre>

		<para>
		can be also specified as:
		</para>

<pre>
byLeft => [ "acctSrc/source", "acctXtrId/external" ],
</pre>

		<para>
		The option name <quote>byLeft</quote> says that the pattern specification is for the
		fields on the left side (there is no symmetric <quote>byRight</quote>). The
		substitutions produce the matching field names for the right side.
		Unlike the result pattern, here the fields that do not find a match do
		not get included in the key. It's as if an implicit <pre>"!.*"</pre> gets added at
		the end. In fact, <pre>"!.*"</pre> really does get added implicitly at the end.
		</para>

		<para>
		Of course, for the example above either option doesn't make much
		difference. It starts making the difference when the key fields follow
		a pattern. For example, if the key fields on both sides have the names
		<pre>acctSrc</pre> and <pre>acctXtrId</pre>, the specification with the <quote>byLeft</quote>
		becomes a little simpler:
		</para>

<pre>
byLeft => [ "acctSrc", "acctXtrId" ],
</pre>

		<para>
		Even more so if the key is long, common on both sides, and all the
		fields have a common prefix. Such as:
		</para>

<pre>
k_AccountSystem
k_AccountId
k_InstrumentSystem
k_InstrumentId
k_TransactionDate
k_SettlementDate
</pre>

		<para>
		Then the join condition can be specified simply as:
		</para>

<pre>
byLeft => [ "k_.*" ],
</pre>

		<para>
		If say the settlement date doesn't matter for a particular join, it can be excluded:
		</para>

<pre>
byLeft => [ "!k_SettlementDate", "k_.*" ],
</pre>

		<para>
		If the right side represents a swap of securities, it might have two
		parts to it, each describing its half with its key:
		</para>

<pre>
BorrowAccountSystem
BorrowAccountId
BorrowInstrumentSystem
BorrowInstrumentId
BorrowTransactionDate
BorrowSettlementDate
LoanAccountSystem
LoanAccountId
LoanInstrumentSystem
LoanInstrumentId
LoanTransactionDate
LoanSettlementDate
</pre>

		<para>
		Then the join of the one-sided rows with the borrow part condition can be done using:
		</para>

<pre>
byLeft => [ 'k_(.*)/Borrow$1' ],
</pre>

		<para>
		The key patterns make the long keys easier to drag around.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>key field types</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Second, key fields of LookupJoin don't have to be of the same type on
		the left and on the right side. Since the key building for lookup is
		done through Perl, the key values get automatically converted as
		needed. 
		</para>

		<para>
		A caveat is that the conversion might be not exactly direct. If a
		string gets converted to a number, then any string values that do not
		look like numbers will be converted to 0. A conversion between a string
		and a floating-point number, in either direction, is likely to lose
		precision. A conversion between int64 and int32 may cause the upper
		bits to be truncated. So what gets looked up may be not what you
		expect.
		</para>

		<para>
		I'm not sure yet if I should add the requirement for the types being
		exactly the same. The automatic conversions seem to be convenient, just
		use them with care. I suppose, when the joins will get eventually
		implemented in the &Cpp; code, this freedom would go away because it's
		much easier and more efficient in &Cpp; to copy the field values as-is
		than to convert them.
		</para>

		<para>
		The only thing currently checked is whether a field is represented in
		Perl as a scalar or an array, and that must match on the left and on
		the right. Note that the array <pre>uint8[]</pre> gets represented in Perl as a
		scalar string, so an <pre>uint8[]</pre> field can be matched with other scalars
		but not with the other arrays.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>key field duplication</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Third, the key fields have the problem of duplication. The LookupJoin is
		by definition an equi-join, it joins together the rows that have the
		same values in a set of key fields. If all the fields from both sides
		are to be included in the result, they key values will be present in it
		twice, once from the left side, once from the right side. This is not
		what is usually wanted, and the good practice is to let these fields
		through from one side and filter out from the other side.
		</para>

		<para>
		Letting these fields through on the left side is usually the better
		choice. For the inner joins it doesn't really matter but for the
		left outer joins it works much better than the with letting through
		the fields from the right side. The reason is that when the join
		doesn't find the match on the right side, all the right-side
		fields will be NULL. If you pass through the key fields only from the
		right side, they will contain NULL, and this is probably not what
		you want.
		</para>

		<para>
		However if for some reason, be it the order of the fields or the
		better field types on the right side, you really want to pass the
		key fields only from the right side, you can. LookupJoin provides
		a special magic act enabled by the option
		</para>

<pre>
	fieldsMirrorKey => 1
</pre>

		<para>
		Then if the row is not found on the right side, a special right-side
		row will be created with the key fields copied from the left side,
		and it will be used to produce the result row. With
		<quote>fieldsMirrorKey</quote> you are guaranteed to always have the
		key values present on the right side.
		</para>
	</sect1>

		<title>A peek inside LookupJoin</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>LookupJoin</primary>
			<secondary>code generation</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		I won't be describing in the details the internals of LookupJoin. They
		seem a bit too big and complicated. Partially it's because the code is
		of an older origin, and not using all the newer calls. Partially it's
		because when I wrote it, I've tried to optimize by translating the rows
		to an array format instead of referring to the fields by names, and
		that made the code more tricky. Partially, the code has grown more
		complex due to all the added options. And partially the functionality
		just is a little tricky by itself.
		</para>

		<para>
		But, for debugging purposes, the LookupJoin constructor can return the
		auto-generated code of the joiner function. It's done with the option
		<quote>saveJoinerTo</quote>:
		</para>

<pre>

			<primary>JoinTwo</primary>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>tables</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Fundamentally, joining the two tables is kind of like the two
		symmetrical copies of LookupJoin, each of them reacting to the
		changes in one table and doing look-ups in another table. 
		For all I can tell, the CEP systems with the insert-only stream model
		tend to start with the assumption that the LookupJoin (or whetever they
		call it) is good enough. Then it turns out that manually writing the
		join twice where it can be done once is a pain. So the table-to-table
		join gets added. Then the interesting nuances crop up, since a correct
		table-to-table join has more to it than just two stream-to-table
		joins.  Then it turns
		out that it would be real convenient to propagate the deletes through
		the join, and that gets added as a special feature behind the scenes.
		</para>

		<para>
		In Triceps, JoinTwo is the template for joining the tables. And actually
		it is translated under the hood to two LookupJoins, but it has
		more on top of them.
		</para>

		<para>
		In a common
		database a join query causes a join plan to be created: on what table
		to iterate, and in which to look up next. A CEP system deals with the
		changing data, and a join has to react to the data changes on each of its
		input tables. It must have multiple plans, one for starting from each
		of the tables. And essentially a LookupJoin embodies such a plan, and
		JoinTwo makes two of them.
		</para>

		<para>
		Why only two? Because it's the minimal usable number. The join logic is
		tricky, so it's better to work out the kinks on something simpler first. And
		it still can be scaled to many tables by joining them in stages. It's
		not quite as efficient as a direct join of multiple tables, because the
		result of each stage has to be put into a table, but it does the job.
		</para>

		<para>
		I'll be doing the demonstrations of the table joins on an application
		example from the area of stock lending. Think of a large multinational
		broker that wants to keep track of its lending activities. It has many
		customers to whom the stock can be loaned or from whom it can be
		borrowed. This information comes as the records of positions, of how
		many shares are loaned or borrowed for each customer, and at what
		contractual price. And since the clients are from all around the world,
		the prices may be in different currencies. A simplified and much
		shortened version of the position information may look like this:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t -->
<pre>
our $rtPosition = Triceps::RowType->new( # a customer account position
	date => "int32", # as of which date, in format YYYYMMDD
	customer => "string", # customer account id
	symbol => "string", # stock symbol
	quantity => "float64", # number of shares
	price => "float64", # share price in local currency
	currency => "string", # currency code of the price
) or confess "$!";
</pre>

		<para>
		Then we want to aggregate these data in different ways, getting the
		broker-wide summaries by the symbol, by customer etc. The aggregation
		is updated as the business day goes on. At the end of the business day
		the state of the day freezes, and the new day's initial data is loaded.
		That's why the business date is part of the schema. If you wonder, the
		next day's initial data is usually the same as at the end of the
		previous day, except where some contractual conditions change. The
		detailed position data is thrown away after a few days, or even right
		at the end of the day, but the aggregation results from the end of the
		day are kept for a longer history.
		</para>

		<para>
		There is a problem with summing up the monetary values: they come in
		different currencies and can not be added up directly. If we want to
		get this kind of summaries, we have to translate all of them to a
		single reference currency. That's what the sample joins will be doing:
		finding the translation rates to the US dollars. The currency rates
		come in the translation schema:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t -->
<pre>
our $rtToUsd = Triceps::RowType->new( # a currency conversion to USD
	date => "int32", # as of which date, in format YYYYMMDD
	currency => "string", # currency code
	toUsd => "float64", # multiplier to convert this currency to USD
) or confess "$!";
</pre>

		<para>
		Since the currency rates change all the time, to make sense of a
		previous day's position, the previous day's rates need to be kept around,
		and so the rates are also marked with a date.
		</para>

		<para>
		Having the mood set, here is the first example of a model with an inner
		join:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t table types, no $ixt..., doJoinInner -->
<pre>
# exchange rates, to convert all currencies to USD
our $ttToUsd = Triceps::TableType->new($rtToUsd)
	->addSubIndex("primary",
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "date", "currency" ])
	)
	->addSubIndex("byDate", # for cleaning by date
		Triceps::SimpleOrderedIndex->new(date => "ASC")
		->addSubIndex("grouping", Triceps::IndexType->newFifo())
	)
or confess "$!";
$ttToUsd->initialize() or confess "$!";

# the positions in the original currency
our $ttPosition = Triceps::TableType->new($rtPosition)
	->addSubIndex("primary",
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "date", "customer", "symbol" ])
	)
	->addSubIndex("currencyLookup", # for joining with currency conversion
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "date", "currency" ])
		->addSubIndex("grouping", Triceps::IndexType->newFifo())
	)
	->addSubIndex("byDate", # for cleaning by date
		Triceps::SimpleOrderedIndex->new(date => "ASC")
		->addSubIndex("grouping", Triceps::IndexType->newFifo())
	)
or confess "$!";
$ttPosition->initialize() or confess "$!";

our $uJoin = Triceps::Unit->new("uJoin");

our $tToUsd = $uJoin->makeTable($ttToUsd, 
	"EM_CALL", "tToUsd") or confess "$!";
our $tPosition = $uJoin->makeTable($ttPosition, 
	"EM_CALL", "tPosition") or confess "$!";

our $join = Triceps::JoinTwo->new(
	name => "join",
	leftTable => $tPosition,
	leftIdxPath => [ "currencyLookup" ],
	rightTable => $tToUsd,
	rightIdxPath => [ "primary" ],
	type => "inner",
); # would confess by itself on an error

# label to print the changes to the detailed stats
makePrintLabel("lbPrint", $join->getOutputLabel());

while(&readLine) {
	chomp;
	my @data = split(/,/); # starts with a command, then string opcode
	my $type = shift @data;
	if ($type eq "cur") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($tToUsd->getInputLabel(), @data);
	} elsif ($type eq "pos") {
		$uJoin->makeArrayCall($tPosition->getInputLabel(), @data);
	}
	$uJoin->drainFrame(); # just in case, for completeness
}
</pre>

		<para>
		The example just does the joining, leaving the aggregation to the
		imagination of the reader. The result of a JoinTwo is not stored in a
		table. It is a stream of ephemeral updates, same as for LookupJoin. If
		you want to keep them, you can put them into a table yourself (and
		maybe do the aggregation in the same table).
		</para>

		<para>
		Both the joined tables must provide a Hashed index for the efficient
		joining.  The index may be leaf (selecting one row per key) or non-leaf
		(containing multiple rows per key) but it must be there. This makes
		sure that the joins are always efficient and you don't have to hunt for
		why your model is suddenly so slow.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>key field order</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The indexes also provide the default way of finding the join condition:
		the key fields in the indexes are paired up together, in the order they
		go in the index specifications. Once again, the fields are paired not
		by name but by order. If the indexes are nested, the outer indexes
		precede in the order. For example, the <pre>$ttToUsd</pre> could have the same
		index done in a nested way and it would work just as well:
		</para>

<pre>
	->addSubIndex("byDate",
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "date" ])
		->addSubIndex("primary",
			Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "currency" ])
		)
	) 
</pre>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>index</primary>
			<secondary>hashed</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Same as with LookupJoin, currently only the Hashed indexes are
		supported, and must go through all the path. The outer index <quote>byDate</quote>
		here can not be a Sorted/Ordered index, that would be an error and the
		join will refuse to accept it.
		</para>

		<para>
		But if the order of key fields in the <pre>$ttToUsd</pre> index were
		changed to be different from <pre>$ttPosition</pre>, like this
		</para>

<pre>
	->addSubIndex("primary",
		Triceps::IndexType->newHashed(key => [ "currency", "date" ])
	) 
</pre>

		<para>
		then it would be a mess. The wrong fields would be matched up in the
		join condition, which would become 
		<pre>(tPosition.date == tToUsd.currency && tPosition.currency == tToUsd.date)</pre>, 
		and everything would go horribly wrong.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>key field types</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Incidentally, this situation in this particular case would be caught
		because JoinTwo is much less lenient than LookupJoin as the key field
		types go. It requires the types of the matching fields to be exactly
		the same. Partially, for the reasons of catching the wrong order,
		partially for the sake of the result consistency. JoinTwo does the
		look-ups in both directions. And think about what happens if a string field
		and an int32 field get matched up, and then the non-numeric strings
		turn up in the string field, containing things like 
		<quote>abc</quote> and <quote>qwerty</quote>. Those strings on the left side
		will match the rows with numeric 0 on the right side. But then if the
		row with 0 on the right side changes, it would look for the string <quote>0</quote>
		on the left, which would not find either <quote>abc</quote> or <quote>qwerty</quote>. The state
		of the join will become a mess. So no automatic key type conversions
		here.
		</para>

		<para>
		If you wonder, there are ways to specify the key fields pairing
		explicitly, with the option <quote>by</quote> or <quote>byLeft</quote>, same as for the
		LookupJoin. But that's all they can do: change the pairing of the
		key fields. You can't specify any other fields. And since they are
		optional for JoinTwo, they get usually skipped.
		</para>

		<para>
		More of the JoinTwo options closely parallel those in LookupJoin.
		Obviously, <quote>name</quote>, <quote>rightTable</quote> and <quote>rightIdxPath</quote> are the same, with
		the added symmetrical <quote>leftTable</quote> and <quote>leftIdxPath</quote>. There is no <quote>unit</quote>
		option though, the unit is always taken from the tables (which must
		belong to the same unit).
		The option to save the source code of the generated joiner code has
		been split in two: <quote>leftSaveJoinerTo</quote> and <quote>rightSaveJoinerTo</quote>. Since
		JoinTwo has to react to the updates from both sides, is has to have two
		handlers. And since internally it uses two LookupJoin for this purpose,
		these happen to be the joiner functions of the left and right
		LookupJoin.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>inner</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The option <quote>type</quote> selects the inner join mode. The inner join is the
		default, and would have been used even if this option was not
		specified.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>key field duplication</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The options controlling the result are also the same as in LookupJoin: <quote>leftFields</quote>,
		<quote>rightFields</quote>, <quote>fieldsLeftFirst</quote>.
		The results in this example include all the fields from both sides by default.
		JoinTwo is smart and knows how to exclude the duplicate key fields automatically.
		</para>

		<para>
		The joins are currently not equipped to actually compute the translated
		prices directly. They can only look up the information for it, and the
		computation can be done later, before or during the aggregation.
		</para>

		<para>
		That's enough explanations for now, let's look at the result. The
		input rows are shown as usual in bold, and to make keeping track easier,
		I broke up the output into short snippets with commentary after each one.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,USD,1
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,GBP,2
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,EUR,1.5
</exdump>

		<para>
		Inserting the reference currencies produces no result, since it's an
		inner join and they have no matching positions yet.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,one,AAA,100,15,USD
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="one" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="15" currency="USD" toUsd="1" 
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,two,AAA,100,8,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		Now the positions arrive and find the matching translations to USD. The
		label names on the output are an interesting artifact of all the
		chained labels receiving the original rowop that refers to the first
		label in the chain. Which happens to be the output label of a
		LookupJoin inside JoinTwo. It works conveniently for the
		demonstrational purposes, since the name of that LookupJoin shows whether
		the row that triggered the result came from the left or right side of
		the JoinTwo.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,three,AAA,100,300,RUR
</exdump>

		<para>
		This position is out of luck: no translation for its currency. The
		inner join is actually not a good choice here. If a row does not pass
		through because of the lack of translation, it gets excluded even from
		the aggregations that do not require the translation, such as those
		that total up the quantity of a particular symbol across all the
		customers. A left outer join would have been suited better.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,three,BBB,200,80,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		Another position arrives, same as before.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,RUR,0.04
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" toUsd="0.04" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The translation for RUR finally comes in. The position in RUR can now
		find its match and propagate through.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_DELETE,20120310,GBP,2
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,GBP,2.2
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		An exchange rate update for GBP arrives. It amounts to <quote>delete the old
		translation and then insert a new one</quote>. Each of these operations
		updates the state of the join: the disappearing translation causes all
		the GBP positions to be deleted from the result, and the new
		translation inserts them back, with the new value of toUsd.
		Which is the correct behavior: to make an up date to the result
		positions, they have to be deleted and then inserted witn the new values.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinInner -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_DELETE,20120310,one,AAA,100,15,USD
join.leftLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="one" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="15" currency="USD" toUsd="1" 
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,one,AAA,200,16,USD
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="one" symbol="AAA" quantity="200" price="16" currency="USD" toUsd="1" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		A position update arrives. Again, it's a delete-and-insert, and
		propagates through the join as such.
		</para>

		<para>
		That's the end of the first example. The commentary said that the
		left outer join would have been better for the logic, so let's make
		one for the left outer join.  All we need to change is the join type option:
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>left outer</secondary>
		</indexterm>
<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::JoinTwo->new(
	name => "join",
	leftTable => $tPosition,
	leftIdxPath => [ "currencyLookup" ],
	rightTable => $tToUsd,
	rightIdxPath => [ "primary" ],
	type => "left",
); # would confess by itself on an error
</pre>

		<para>
		Now the positions would pass through even if the currency translation
		is not available. The same input now produces a different result:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,USD,1
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,GBP,2
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,EUR,1.5
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,one,AAA,100,15,USD
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="one" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="15" currency="USD" toUsd="1" 
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,two,AAA,100,8,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		So far things are going the same as for the inner join.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,three,AAA,100,300,RUR
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The first difference: even though there is no translation for RUR, the
		row still passes through (with the field <pre>toUsd</pre> being NULL).
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,three,BBB,200,80,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		This is also unchanged.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,RUR,0.04
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" toUsd="0.04" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The second difference: since this row from the left side has already
		passed through, just sending another INSERT for it would make the data
		inconsistent. The original result without the translation must be
		deleted first, and then a new one, with translation, inserted. JoinTwo
		is smart enough to figure it out all by itself.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_DELETE,20120310,GBP,2
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The same logic works for the deletes, only backwards: when the
		translation for GBP is deleted, the result rows that used it change to
		the lose the translation.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,GBP,2.2
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		And again, when the new translation for GBP comes in, the DELETE-INSERT
		sequence is done for each of the rows. As you can see, the update of
		the GBP translation in the last two snippets worked in not the most efficient way.
		Fundamentally, if we knew that a DELETE of GBP will be immediately
		followed by an INSERT, we could skip inserting and then deleting the
		rows with the NULL in <pre>toUsd</pre>. But we don't know, and in Triceps there is
		no way to know it.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>no primary key</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>with collapse</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		If you really, really want to avoid the propagation of these
		intermediate changes, insert after the join a Collapse template described in 
		XXXX add the reference
		, and flush it only
		after the whole update has been processed. There will be more overhead
		in the Collapse itself, but all the logic below it will skip the
		intermediate changes. If this logic below is heavy-weight, that might
		be an overall win. A caveat though: a Collapse requires that the data
		has a primary key, a JoinTwo doesn't require its result (nor its
		inputs) to have a primary key. Because of this, the collapse might not
		work right with every possible join, you'd have to limit yourself to
		the joins that produce the data with a primary key.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinLeft, except day and clear -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_DELETE,20120310,one,AAA,100,15,USD
join.leftLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="one" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="15" currency="USD" toUsd="1" 
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,one,AAA,200,16,USD
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="one" symbol="AAA" quantity="200" price="16" currency="USD" toUsd="1" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		And the rest is again the same as with an inner join.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>right outer</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		JoinTwo can do a right outer join too, just use the type <quote>right</quote>. It
		works in exactly the same way as the left outer join, just with a
		different table. So much the same that it's not even worth a separate
		example.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>full outer</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Now, the full outer join. 
		The full outer joins usually
		get used with a variation of the <quote>fork-join</quote> topology described in the
		XXX add reference. 
		In it the processing of a row can be forked into
		multiple parallel paths, each path doing an optional part of the
		comuptation and either providing a result row or not,
		eventually with all the parts merged back together into one row. 
		The full outer join is a convenient
		way to do this merge: the paths that didn't produce the result get
		quietly ignored, and the results that were produced get merged back
		into a single row. The row in such situations is usually identified by
		a primary key, so the partial results can find each other. This scheme
		makes the most sense when the paths are executed in the parallel
		threads, or when the processing on some paths may get delayed and then
		continued later. If the processing is single-threaded and fast, Triceps
		provides a more convenient procedural way of getting the same result:
		just call every path in order and merge the results from them
		procedurally, and you won't have to keep the intermediate results in
		their tables forever, nor delete them manually.
		</para>

		<para>
		Even though that use is typical, it has only the 1:1 record matching
		and does not highlight all the abilities of the JoinTwo. So, let's come
		up with another example that does.
		</para>

		<para>
		The positions-and-currencies do not lend itself easily to 
		a full outer join but we'll make them do.  Suppose that you want to get the total count of
		positions (per symbol, or altogether), or maybe the total value, for
		every currency. Including those for which we have the exchange rates
		but no positions, for them the count should simply be 0 (or maybe
		NULL). And those for which there are positions but no exchange rate translations.
		This is a job for a full outer join, followed by an aggregation. The
		join has the type <quote>outer</quote> and looks like this:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::JoinTwo->new(
	name => "join",
	leftTable => $tPosition,
	leftIdxPath => [ "currencyLookup" ],
	rightTable => $tToUsd,
	rightIdxPath => [ "primary" ],
	type => "outer",
); # would confess by itself on an error
</pre>

		<para>
		As before, the aggregation part will be left to the
		imagination of the reader. 
		This join has the many-to-one (M:1) row matching, since there might be
		multiple positions on the left matching one currency rate translation
		on the right. This will create interesting effects in the output,
		let's look at it:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,GBP,2
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The first translation gets through, even though there is no position for it yet.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,two,AAA,100,8,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The first position for an existing translation comes in. Now the GBP
		row has a match, so the unmatched row gets deleted and a matched one
		gets inserted instead.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,three,BBB,200,80,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The second position for GBP works differently: since there is no
		unmatched row any more (it was taken care of by the first position),
		there is nothing to delete. Just the second matched row gets
		inserted. 
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_INSERT,20120310,three,AAA,100,300,RUR
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		The position without a matching currency get through as well.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,RUR,0.04
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" toUsd="0.04" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		Now the RUR translation becomes available and it has to do the same
		things as we've seen before, only on the other side: delete the
		unmatched record and replace it with the matched one.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> cur,OP_DELETE,20120310,GBP,2
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" 
> cur,OP_INSERT,20120310,GBP,2.2
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="two" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="8" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" 
join.rightLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		Then the GBP translation gets updated. First the old translation gets
		deleted and then the new one inserted. When the translation gets
		deleted, all the positions in GBP lose their match. So the matched rows
		gets deleted and replaced with the unmatched ones. When the new GBP
		translation is inserted, the replacement goes in the other
		direction.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_DELETE,20120310,three,BBB,200,80,GBP
join.leftLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="BBB" quantity="200" price="80" currency="GBP" toUsd="2.2" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		When this position goes away, the row gets deleted from the result as
		well. However it was not the only position in GBP, so there is no need
		to insert an unmatched record for GBP.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t doJoinOuter -->
<exdump>
> pos,OP_DELETE,20120310,three,AAA,100,300,RUR
join.leftLookup.out OP_DELETE date="20120310" customer="three" symbol="AAA" quantity="100" price="300" currency="RUR" toUsd="0.04" 
join.leftLookup.out OP_INSERT date="20120310" currency="RUR" toUsd="0.04" 
</exdump>

		<para>
		This position was the last one in RUR. So when it gets deleted, the RUR
		translation has no match any more. That means, after deleting the
		matched row from the results, the unmatched row has to be
		inserted to keep the balance right.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>to-many</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		This business with keeping track of the unmatched rows is
		not unique to the full outer joins. Remember, it was showing in the
		left outer joins too, and the right outer joins are no exception
		either. When the first matching row gets inserted or the last matching
		row gets deleted on the side that is opposite to the "outer side", the
		unmatched rows have to be handled in the result. (That would be the
		right side for the left outer joins, the left side for the right outer
		joins, and either side for the full outer joins).
		The special thing about the M:1 (and 1:M and M:M) joins is that
		there may be more than one matching row.
		On insertion, the second and following matching rows produce a different 
		effect than the first one. On deletion, the opposite: all the
		rows but the last work differently from the last one.
		It's not limited to the full outer joins. M:1 or M:M with a right outer
		join, and 1:M or M:M with a left outer join will do it too.
		</para>

		<para>
		If you're like me, by now you'd be wondering, how does it work? If the
		<quote>opposite side</quote> is of <quote>one</quote> variety (:1 or 1:), which can be known from
		it using a leaf index for the join, then every insert is the first
		insert of a matching row for this key, and every delete is the delete
		of the last row for this key. Which means, do the empty-match business
		every time.
		</para>

		<para>
		If the <quote>opposite side</quote> is of the <quote>many</quote> variety (:M or M:), with a
		non-leaf index, then things get more complicated. The join works by
		processing the rowops coming out of the argument tables. When it gets
		the rowop in such a situation, it goes to the table and checks, was it
		the first (or last) row for this key? And then uses this knowledge to
		act.
