		<para>
		The joins are quite important for the relational data processing, and
		come in many varieties. And the CEP systems have their own specifics.
		Basically, in CEP you want the joins to be processed fast. The CEP
		systems deal with the changing model state, and have to process these
		changes incrementally.
		</para>

		<para>
		A small change should be handled fast. It has to use the indexes to
		find and update all the related result rows. Even though you can make
		it just go sequentially through all the rows and find the relevant
		ones, like in a common database, that's not what you normally want.
		When something like this happens, the usual reaction is <quote>wtf is my
		model suddenly so slow?</quote> following by an annoyingly long investigation
		into the reasons of the slowness, and then rewriting the model to make
		it work faster. It's better to just prevent the slowness in the first
		place and make sure that the joins always use an index. And since you
		don't have to deal much with the ad-hoc queries when you write a CEP
		model, you can provide all the needed indexes in advance very easily.

			<secondary>equi-join</secondary>

		<para>
		A particularly interesting kind of joins in this regard is the
		equi-joins: ones that join the rows by the equality of the fields in
		them. They allow a very efficient index look-up. Because of this, they
		are popular in the CEP world. Some systems, like Aleri, support only
		the equi-joins to start with. The other systems are much more efficient
		on the equi-joins than on the other kinds of joins. At the moment
		Triceps follows the fashion of having the advanced support only for the
		equi-joins. Even though the Sorted/Ordered indexes in Triceps should allow the
		range-based comparisons to be efficient too, at the moment there are no
		table methods for the look-up of ranges, they are left for the future
		work. Of course, nothing stops you from copying an equi-join template
		and modifying it to work by a dumb iteration. Just it would be slow,
		and I didn't see much point in it.
		</para>

		<para>
		There also are three common patterns of the join usage.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>Coral8</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>lookup</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>stream-to-window</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		In the first pattern the rows sort of go by and get enriched by looking
		up some information from a table and tacking it onto these rows.
		Sometimes not even tacking it on but maybe just filtering the data:
		passing through some of the rows and throwing away the rest, or
		directing the rows into the different kinds of processing, based on the
		looked-up data. For a reference, in the Coral8 CCL this situation is
		called <quote>stream-to-window joins</quote>. In Triceps there are no streams and no
		windows, so I just call them the <quote>lookup joins</quote>.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>tables</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		In the second pattern multiple stateful tables are joined together.
		Whenever any of the tables changes, the join result also changes, and
		the updates get propagated through. This can be done through lookups,
		but in reality it turns out that defining manually the lookups for the
		every possible table change becomes tedious pretty quickly. This has to
		be addressed by the automation.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>self</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		In the third pattern the same table gets joined recursively,
		essentially traversing a representation of a tree stored in that table.
		This actually doesn't work well with the classic SQL unless the
		recursion depth is strictly limited. There are SQL extensions for the
		recursive self-joins in the modern databases but I haven't seen them in the
		CEP systems yet. Anyway, the procedural approach tends to work for this
		situation much better than the SQLy one, so the templates tend to be of
		not much help. I'll show a templated and a manual example of this kind
		for comparison.
		</para>

		<title>Hello, joins!</title>

		<para>
		As usual, let me show a couple of little teasers before starting the
		long bottom-up discussion. We'll eventually get by the long
		way to the same examples, so here I'll show only some very short
		code snippets and basic explanations.
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doLookupFull, replaced leftFields from commented-out, removed fieldsLeftFirst, isLeft -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::LookupJoin->new(
	name => "join",
	leftFromLabel => $lbTrans,
	rightTable => $tAccounts,
	rightIdxPath => ["lookupSrcExt"],
	leftFields => [ "!acct.*", ".*" ],
	rightFields => [ "internal/acct" ],
	by => [ "acctSrc" => "source", "acctXtrId" => "external" ],
);
</pre>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>lookup</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		This is a lookup join that gets the incoming rows with transactions
		data from the label <pre>$lbTrans</pre>, finds the account translation in the
		table <pre>$tAccounts</pre>, and translates the external account representation
		to internal one on its output. The join condition is an equivalent of the
		SQLy
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>SQL</primary>
		</indexterm>
<pre>
on 
	lbTrans.acctSrc = tAccounts.source
	and lbTrans.acctXtrId = tAccounts.external
</pre>

		<para>
		The condition looks up the rows in <pre>$tAccounts</pre> using the index <pre>lookupSrcExt</pre>
		that must have the key fields <pre>source</pre> and <pre>external</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		The result fields will contain all the fields from <pre>$lbTrans</pre> except those
		starting with <quote>acct</quote> plus the field <pre>internal</pre> from <pre>$tAccounts</pre>
		that becomes renamed to <pre>acct</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		Next goes a table join:
		</para>

<!-- t/xJoin.t, doJoinInner -->
<pre>
our $join = Triceps::JoinTwo->new(
	name => "join",
	leftTable => $tPosition,
	leftIdxPath => [ "currencyLookup" ],
	rightTable => $tToUsd,
	rightIdxPath => [ "primary" ],
	type => "inner",
);
</pre>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>join</primary>
			<secondary>tables</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		It joins the tables <pre>$tPosition</pre> and <pre>$tToUsd</pre>, with the inner join logic.
		The table <pre>$tPosition</pre> uses its index <pre>currencyLookup</pre>, and <pre>$tToUsd</pre> uses
		its index <pre>primary</pre>. The join condition is determined by pairing the
		key fields of the indexes.
