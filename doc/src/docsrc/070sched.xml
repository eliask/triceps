		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The scheduling determines, in which order the row operations are
		processed. If there are multiple operations available, which one
		should be processed first?  The scheduler keeps a queue of the operations
		and selects, which one to execute next.  This has a major effect on the
		logic of a CEP model.

		<para>
		There are multiple approaches to scheduling. Aleri essentially doesn't
		have any, except for the flow control between threads, because each its
		element is a separate thread. Coral8 has an intricate scheduling
		algorithm. Sybase R5 has the same logic as Coral8 inside each thread.
		StreamBase presumably also has some.
		</para>

		<para>
		The scheduling logic in Triceps is different from the other CEP
		systems. The Coral8 logic looks at first like the only reasonable way
		to go, but could not be used in Triceps for three reasons: First, it's a trade
		secret, so it can't be simply reused. If I'd never seen it, that would
		not be an issue but I've worked on it and implemented its version for
		R5. Second, it relies on the properties that the compiler computes from
		the model graph analysis. Triceps has no compiler, and could not do
		this. Third, in reality it simply doesn't work that well. There are
		quite a few cases when the Coral8 scheduler comes up with a strange and
		troublesome execution order.
		</para>

		<para>
		For a while I've hoped that Triceps would need no scheduler at all, and
		everything would be handled by the procedural calls. This has proved to
		have its own limitations, and thus the labels and their scheduling were
		born. The Triceps scheduling still has issues to resolve, but overall
		it still feels much better than the Coral8 one.
		</para>

	<sect1 id="sc_sched_no_bundling">
		<title>No bundling</title>

		<para>
		The most important principle of Triceps scheduling is: No Bundling.
		Every rowop is for itself. The bundling is what messes up the Coral8
		scheduler the most. 
		</para>

		<para>
		What is a bundle? It's a set of records that go through the execution
		together. If you have a model consisting of two functional elements F1
		and F2 connected in a sequential fashion 
		</para>

<pre>
F1->F2 
</pre>

		<para>
		and a few loose records R1, R2, R3, the
		normal execution order without bundling will be:
		</para>

<pre>
F1(R1), F2(R1), F1(R2), F2(R2), F1(R3), F2(R3)
</pre>

		<para>
		Each row goes through the whole model (a real simple one in this case)
		before the next one is touched. This allows F2 to take into
		accont the state of F1 exactly as it was right after processing
		the same record, without any interventions in between.
		</para>

		<para>
		If the same records are placed in a bundle (R1, R2, R3), the execution
		order will be different:
		</para>

<pre>
F1(R1), F1(R2), F1(R3), F2(R1), F2(R2), F2(R3)
</pre>

		<para>
		The whole bundle goes through F1 before the rows go to F2.
		</para>

		<para>
		That would not be a problem, and even could be occasionally useful, if
		the bundles were always created explicitly. In the reality of Coral8,
		every time a statement produces multiple record from a single one
		(think of a join that picks multiple records from another side), it
		creates a bundle and messes up all the logic after it. Some logic gets
		affected so badly that a few statements in CCL (like ON UPDATE) had to
		be designated as always ignoring the bundles, otherwise they would not
		work at all. At DB I wrote a CCL pattern for breaking up the bundles.
		It's rather heavyweight and thus could not be used all over the place
		but provides a generic solution for the most unpleasant cases.
		</para>

		<para>
		Worse yet, the bundles may get created in Coral8 absolutely
		accidentally: if two records happen to have the same timestamp, for all
		practical purposes they would act as a bundle. In the models that were
		designed without the appropriate guards, this leads to the time-based
		bugs that are hard to catch and debug. Writing these guards correctly
		is hard, and testing them is even harder. 
		</para>

		<para>
		Another issue with bundles is that they make the large queries slower.
		Suppose you do a query from a window that returns a million
		records. All of them will be collected in a bundle, then the
		bundle will be sent to the interface gateway that would build one huge
		protocol packet, which will then be sent to the client, which will
		receive the whole packet and then finally iterate on the records in it.
		Assuming that nothing runs out of memory along the way, it will be a
		long time until the client sees the first record. Very, very
		annoying.
		</para>

		<para>
		Aleri also has its own version of bundles, called transactions, but a
		more smart one. Aleri always relies on the primary keys. The condition
		for a transaction is that it must never contain multiple modification
		for the same primary key. Since there are no execution order guarantees
		between the functional elements, in this respect the transactions work
		in the same way as loose records, only with a more efficient
		communication between threads. Still, if the primary key changes in an
		element (say, an aggregator), the condition does not propagate through
		it. Such elements have to internally collapse the outgoing transactions
		along the new key, adding overhead.
		</para>

		<title>Basic scheduling in Triceps</title>

		<para>
		In Triceps the scheduling is done by the execution unit, or simply
		<quote>unit</quote> as it's often referred to.
		It provides 3 basic ways of executing of a rowop:
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>unit</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>row operation</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Call:</term>
				<listitem>
				<indexterm>
					<primary>call</primary>
				</indexterm>
				<para>
				Execute the label right now, including all the nested calls.
				All of this will be completed after the call returns.
				</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Fork:</term>
				<listitem>
				<indexterm>
					<primary>fork</primary>
				</indexterm>
				<para>
				Execute the label after the current label returns but
				before anything else is done. Obviously, if multiple labels are
				forked, they will execute in order after the current label
				returns (but before its caller gets the control back).
				This method has looked promising at one point but has currently
				fallen out of favor and will likely be removed in the future.
				</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Schedule:</term>
				<listitem>
				<indexterm>
					<primary>schedule</primary>
				</indexterm>
				<para>
				Execute the label after everything else is done.
				</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>

		<para>
		This is kind of intuitively clear but the details might sometimes
		be a bit surprising. So let us look in detail at how it works inside
		on an example of a fairly convoluted scheduling sequence.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>queue</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>frame</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>stack</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>draining</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		A scheduler in the execution unit keeps a stack of queues. Each queue
		is essentially a stack frame, so I'll be using the terms <pre>queue</pre> and
		<pre>frame</pre> interchangeably. The stack always contains at least one
		queue, which is called the outermost stack frame.
		</para>

		<para>
		When the new rowops come from the outside world, they are added with
		<pre>schedule()</pre> to that stack frame. That's what <pre>schedule()</pre> does: always
		adds rowops to the outermost stack frame. If rowops 1, 2 and 3 are
		added, the stack looks like this (the brackets denote a stack frame):
		</para>

<pre>
[1, 2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		The unit method <pre>drainFrame()</pre> is then used to run the
		scheduler and process the rowops. It makes the unit call each rowop on
		the innermost frame (which is initially the same as outermost
		frame, since there is only one frame) in order.
		</para>

		<para>
		First it calls the rowop 1. It's removed from the queue, then a new
		frame is pushed onto the stack:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~1
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		This new frame is the rowop 1's frame, which is marked on the diagram
		by <quote>~1</quote>. The diagram shows the most recently pushed, innermost,
		frame on the top, and the oldest, outermost frame on the bottom. The
		concepts of <quote>innermost</quote> and <quote>outermost</quote>
		come from the nested calls: the most recent call is nested the deepest
		in the middle and is the innermost one.
		</para>

		<para>
		Then the rowop 1 executes. If it
		calls rowop 4, another frame is pushed onto the stack for it:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~4
[ ] ~1
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		Then the rowop 4 executes. The rowop 4 never gets onto any of the queues.
		The call just pushes a new frame and executes the rowop right away.
		The identity of rowop being processed is kept in the call context. A
		call also involves a direct C++ call on the thread stack, and if any
		Perl code is involved, a Perl call too. Because of this, if you nest
		the calls too deeply, you may run out of the thread stack space and
		get it to crash.
		</para>

		<para>
		After the rowop 4 is finished (not calling any other
		rowops), the innermost empty frame is popped before the execution of
		rowop 1 continues. The queue stack reverts to the previous state.
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~1
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		Suppose then rowop 1 forks rowops 5 and 6. They are appended to the
		innermost frame in the order they are forked.
		</para>

<pre>
[5, 6] ~1
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		If rowop 1 then calls rowop 7, again a frame is pushed onto the stack
		before it executes:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~7
[5, 6] ~1
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		The rowops 5 and 6 still don't execute, they keep sitting on the queue
		until the rowop 1 would return.
		After the call of rowop 7 completes, the scheduler stack returns to
		the previous state.
		</para>

		<para>
		Suppose now the execution of rowop 1 completes. But its stack frame can
		not be popped yet, because it is not empty. The scheduler calls
		<pre>drainFrame()</pre> recursively, which picks the next rowop from the innermost
		queue (rowop 5), and calls it, pushing a new stack frame and executing
		the rowop 5 code:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~5
[6] ~1*
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		The former rowop 1's frame is now marked with <quote>~1*</quote>
		for the ease of tracking, even though it has completed.
		</para>

		<para>
		If rowop 5 forks rowop 8, the stack becomes:
		</para>

<pre>
[8] ~5
[6] ~1*
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		When the execution of rowop 5 returns, its queue is also not empty. So
		the scheduler starts draining the innermost frame again, and calls rowop 8.
		During its execution the stack is:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~8
[ ] ~5*
[6] ~1*
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		Suppose the rowop 8 doesn't call or fork anything else and returns. Its
		innermost queue is empty, so the call completes and pops the stack
		frame:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~5*
[6] ~1*
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		Now the queue of rowop 5 is also empty, so its draining completes and
		pops the drained frame:
		</para>

<pre>
[6] ~1*
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		The draining of the rowop 1's frame continues by picking the rowop 6
		from the queue and calling it:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~6
[ ] ~1*
[2, 3]
</pre>

		<para>
		Suppose rowop 6 calls <pre>schedule()</pre> of rowop 9. Rowop 9 is then
		added to the outermost queue:
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~6
[ ] ~1*
[2, 3, 9]
</pre>

		<para>
		Rowop 6 then returns, its queue is empty, so it's popped and its call completes.
		</para>

<pre>
[ ] ~1*
[2, 3, 9]
</pre>

		<para>
		Now the queue of rowop 1 has become empty, so it's popped from the
		stack and the call of rowop 1 completes:
		</para>

<pre>
[2, 3, 9]
</pre>

		<para>
		The unit method <pre>drainFrame()</pre> keeps running on the outermost
		frame, now taking the rowop 2 and executing it, and so on, until the
		outermost queue becomes empty, and <pre>drainFrame()</pre> returns.
		</para>

		<para>
