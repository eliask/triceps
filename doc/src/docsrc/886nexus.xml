		<title>Nexus reference</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>Nexus</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The Nexus object is an Mtarget, and safe to access from multiple
		threads. It's defined in <pre>app/Nexus.h</pre>. 
		The Nexus class is pretty much opaque. It's created and managed
		entirely inside the App infrastructure from a Facet, and even the
		public API for importing a nexus doesn't deal with the Nexus object
		itself, but only with its name. The only public use of the Nexus object
		is for the introspection and entertainment value, to see what Trieads
		export and import what Nexuses: pretty much the only way to get a Nexus
		reference is by listing the exports or imports of a Triead.
		</para>

		<para>
		The API of a Nexus is very limited:
		</para>

<pre>
const string &getName() const;
</pre>

		<para>
		Get the name of the nexus (the short name, inside the Triead).
		</para>

<pre>
const string &getTrieadName() const;
</pre>

		<para>
		Get the name of the Triead that exported this nexus.
		</para>

<pre>
bool isReverse() const;
</pre>

		<para>
		Check whether the nexus is reverse.
		</para>

<pre>
int queueLimit() const;
</pre>

		<para>
		Get the queue limit of the nexus.
		</para>
