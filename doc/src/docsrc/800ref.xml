	<title>Triceps Perl API Reference</title>

		<para>
		There are two distinct ways to descibe something, a <quote>guide</quote> and
		a <quote>reference</quote>. Most of this manual is a guide: it goes
		by describing things by examples, together with the idioms of their
		usage, and with the explanation of the internal structure and
		underlying reasons. However if you already know how things work
		and need to look up the trivia, a reference with its short
		and dry descriptions comes handy. Besides, some methods of the classes
		essentially are the trivia, and there is no point in making
		elaborate examples about them. The reference for the whole
		Perl API is collected here, organized by classes.
		Eventually it should be placed into the man pages as well, but
		so far I haven't got around to do it.
		</para>

		<para>
		Some of the classes are so fundamental that the guide sections
		about them were essentially of the reference type, with the
		use being shown in all the examples of the manual. In such cases
		I'm not copying them here, instead please refer to the relevant
		chapters:
