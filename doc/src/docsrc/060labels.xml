	<title>Row Operations With Labels</title>

	<sect1 id="sc_Labels">
		<title>Labels</title>

		<para>
		In each CEP engine there are two kinds of logic: One is to get some
		request, look up some state, maybe update some state, and return the
		result. The other has to do with the maintenance of the state: make
		sure that when one part of the state is changed, the change propagates
		consistently through the rest of it. If we take a common RDBMS for an
		analog, the first kind would be like the ad-hoc queries, the second
		kind will be like the triggers. The CEP engines are very much like
		database engines driven by triggers, so the second kind tends to
		account for a lot of code.
		</para>

		<para>
		The first kind of logic is often very nicely accommodated by the
		procedural logic. The second kind often (but not always) can benefit
		from a more relational, SQLy definition. However the SQLy definitions
		don't stay SQLy for long.  When every every SQL
		statement executes, it gets compiled first into the procedural form,
		and only then executes as the procedural code.
		</para>

		<para>
		The Triceps approach is tilted toward the procedural execution. That is,
		the procedural definitions come out of the box, and then the high-level
		relational logic can be defined on top of them with the templates and
		code generators.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>label</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		These bits of code, especially where the first and second kind connect,
		need some way to pass the data and operations between them. In Triceps
		these connection points are called Labels.
		</para>

		<para>
		The streaming data rows enter the procedural logic through a label.
		Each row causes one call on the label. From the functional standpoint
		they are the same as Coral8 Streams, as has been shown in
		<xref linkend="sc_1950s" xrefstyle="select: label quotedtitle pageabbrev"/>&#xA0;.
		Except that in Triceps the labels receive not just
		rows but operations on rows, as in Aleri: a combination of a row and an
		operation code. 
		</para>

		<para>
		They are named <quote>labels</quote> because Triceps has been built
		around the more procedural ideas, and when looked at from that side,
		the labels are targets of calls and GOTOs.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>data flow</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<indexterm>
			<primary>GOTO</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		If the streaming model is defined as a data flow graph, each arrow in
		the graph is essentially a GOTO operation, and each node is a label.
		</para>

		<para>
		A Triceps label is not quite a GOTO label, since the actual procedural
		control always returns back after executing the label's code. It can be
		thought of as a label of a function or procedure. But if the caller
		does nothing but immedially return after getting the control back, it
		works very much like a GOTO label.
		</para>

		<para>
		Each label accepts operations on rows of a certain type.
		</para>

		<para>
		Each label belongs to a certain execution unit, so a label can be used
		only strictly inside one thread and can not be shared between threads.
		</para>

		<para>
		Each label may have some code to execute when it receives a row
		operation. The labels without code can be useful too.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>label</primary>
			<secondary>chaining</secondary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		A Triceps model contains the straightforward code and the mode complex
		stateful elements, such as tables, aggregators, joiners (which may be
		implemented in &Cpp; or in Perl, or created as user templates). These
		stateful elements would have some input labels, where the actions may
		be sent to them (and the actions may also be done as direct method
		calls), and output labels, where they would produce the indications of
		the changed state and/or responses to the queries. This is shown
		schematically in
		<xref linkend="fig_label_chain" xrefstyle="select: label nopage"/>.
		The output labels
		are typically the ones without code (<quote>dummy labels</quote>). They do nothing
		by themselves, but can pass the data to the other labels. This passing
		of data is achieved by <i>chaining</i> the labels: when a label is
		called, it will first execute its own code (if it has any), and then
		call the same operation on whatever labels are chained from it. Which
		may have more labels chained from them in turn. So, to pass the data,
		chain the input label of the following element to the output label of
		the previous element.
