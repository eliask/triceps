		<para>
		The release policy of Triceps is aimed towards the easy development.
		As the new features are added (or sometimes removed), they are checked into
		the SVN repository and documented in the blog form at
		<ulink url="http://babkin-cep.blogspot.com/"/>. Periodically 
		the documentation updates are collected from the blog into this manual,
		and the official releases are produced.
		</para>

		<para>
		If you want to try out the most bleeding-edge features that have been
		described on the blog but not officially released yet, you can get the
		most recent code directly from the SVN repository.  The SVN code can be
		checked out with
		</para>

<pre>
svn co https://triceps.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/triceps/trunk

		<para>
		The tested reference build environment is where I do the Triceps development,
		and currently it is Linux Fedora 11. The build should work
		automatically on the other Linux systems as well but has not been tested
		much in practice.
		</para>

		<para>
		The build should work on the other Unix environments too but would
		require some manual configuration for the available libraries,
		and has not been tested either.
		</para>

		<para>
		Currently you must use the GNU Linux toolchain: GNU make, GNU C++ 
		compiler (version 4.4.1 has been tested), glibc, valgrind. You can build
		without valgrind by running only the non-valgrind tests.
		</para>

		<para>
		The tested Perl version is 5.10.0, and should work on any later version
		as well. With the earlier versions your luck may vary. The Makefile.PL
		has been configured to require at least 5.8.0 but you may edit it and
		try building on the older versions.
		</para>

		<para>
		I am interested in hearing the reports about builds in various environments.
		</para>

		<para>
		The normal build expectation is for the 64-bit machines. The 32-bit
		machines should work (and the code even includes the special cases for
		them) but have been untested at the moment. Some of the tests might fail
		of the 32-bit and/or big-endian machines due to the different computation
		of the hash values, and thus producing a different row order in the result.

		<para>
		If everything works, the basic build is simple, go to the Triceps
		directory and run:
		</para>

<pre>
make all
make test
</pre>

		<para>
		That would build and test both the &Cpp; and Perl portions of Triceps.
		The &Cpp; libraries will be created under <pre>cpp/build</pre>.
		The Perl libraries will be created under <pre>perl/Triceps/blib</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		The tests are normally run with valgrind for the &Cpp; part, without valgrind
		for the Perl part. The reason is that Perl produces lots of false positives,
		and the suppressions depend on particular Perl versions and are not
		exactly reliable.
		</para>

		<para>
		If your system differs substantially, you may need to adjust the
		configurable settings manually, since there is no <pre>./configure</pre> script
		in the Triceps build yet. More information about them is in the

		</indexterm>
		<para>
		If you have downloaded the release package of Triceps, the documentation
		is already included it in the built form. The PDF and HTML versions are
		available in <pre>doc/pdf</pre> and <pre>doc/html</pre>. It is also available online from
		<ulink url="http://triceps.sf.net"/>.
		</para>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>DocBook</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		The documentation is formatted in DocBook, that produces the PDF
		and HTML outputs.
		If you check out the source from SVN and want to build the documentation,
		you need to download the DocBook tools needed to build it. 
		I hate the dependency situations, when to build something you need
		to locate, build and download dozens of other packages firsti,
		and then the versions turn out to be updated, and don't want
		to work together, and all kinds of hell break loose.
		To make things easier, I've collected the set of packages that
		I've used for the build and that are known to work.
		They've collected in <ulink url="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/triceps/docbook-for-1.0/"/>.
		The DocBook packages come originally from <ulink url="http://docbook.sf.net"/>,
		plus a few extra packages that by now I forgot where I've got from.
		An excellent book on the DocBook tools and their configuration is
		<biblioref linkend="Stayton07"/>. And if you're interested, the
		text formatting in Docbook is described in
		<biblioref linkend="Walsh99"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
		DocBook is great in the way it takes cary of great many things
		automatically but configuring it is plainly a bitch. Fortunately,
		it's all already taken care of. I've reused the infrastructure I've
		built for my book <biblioref linkend="Babkin10"/> for Triceps.
		Though some elements got dropped and some added.
		</para>

		<para>
		Downloading and extraction of the DocBook tools gets taken care of
		by running
		</para>

<pre>
make -C doc/dbtools
</pre>

		<para>
		These tools are written in Java, and the packages are already the
		compiled binaries, so they don't need to be built. As long as
		you have the Java runtime environment, they just run. However
		like many Java packages, they are sloppy and often don't return
		the correct return codes on errors. So the results of the build
		have to be checked visually afterwards.
		</para>

		<para>
		The build also uses Ghostscript for converting the figues
		from the EPS format. The luck with Ghostscript versions
		also varies. The version 8.70 works for me.
		I've seen some versions crash on this conversion.
		Fortunately, it was crashing after the conversion actually
		succeeded, so a workaround was to ignore the exit code
		from Ghostscript.
		</para>

		<para>
		After the tools have been extracted, the build is done by
		</para>

<pre>
make -C doc/src
</pre>

		<para>
		The temporary files are cleaned with

<pre>
make -C doc/src cleanwork
</pre>

		<para>
		The results will be in <pre>doc/pdf</pre> and <pre>doc/html</pre>. 
		</para>

		<para>
		If like me you plan to use the DocBook tools repeatedly
		to build the docs for different versions of Triceps,
		you can download and extract them once in some other
		directory and then set the exported variable 
		<pre>TRICEPS_TOOLS_BASE</pre> to point to it.

		<title>Running the examples and simple programs</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>examples</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		Overall, the examples live together with unit tests.
		The primary target language for Triceps is Perl, so the examples
		from the manual are the Perl examples located in
		<pre>perl/Triceps/t</pre>. The files with names starting with <quote><pre>x</pre></quote> contain
		the examples as such, like <pre>xWindow.t</pre>. 
		Usually there are multiple related
		examples in the same file. And they are not quite exactly the same as
		the ones in the manual, because they are plugged into the unit test
		infrastructure: rather than reading and writing to the stdin and
		stdout, they take the inputs from variables, put the results into
		variables, and have the results checked for correctness. This way the
		examples stay working and do not experience the bit rot when something
		changes.
		</para>

		<para>
		The other unit tests in the <pre>.t</pre> files are interesting too, since they
		contain absolutely all the possible usages of everything, and can be
		used as a reference. However they tend to be much more messy and hard
		to read, exactly because they contain in them lots of tiny snippets
		that do everything.
		</para>

		<para>
		The easiest way to start trying out your own small programs is to place
		them into the same directory <pre>perl/Triceps/t</pre> and run them from
		there. Just name them with the suffix <pre>.pl</pre>, so that they would
		not be picked up by the Perl unit test infrastructre (or if you do want
		to run them as a part of unit tests, use the suffix <pre>.t</pre>).
		</para>

		<para>
		To make your programs find the Triceps modules, start them with
		</para>

<pre>
use ExtUtils::testlib;
use Triceps;
use Carp;
</pre>

		<para>
		The module <pre>ExtUtils::testlib</pre> takes care of setting the
		include paths to find Triceps. You can run them from the parent
		directory, like:
		</para>

<pre>
perl t/xWindow.t
</pre>

		<para>
		The parent directory is the only choice, since <pre>ExtUtils::testlib</pre>
		can not set up the include paths properly from the other directories.

		<title>Installation of the Perl library</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>installation</primary>
		</indexterm>
		<para>
		If you have the root permissions on the machine and want to install
		Triceps in the central location, just run
		</para>

<pre>
make -C perl/Triceps install
</pre>

		<para>
		If you don't, there are multiple options. One is to create your
		private Perl hierarchy in the home directory. If you decide to
		put it into <pre>$HOME/inst</pre>, the installation there becomes
		</para>

<pre>
mkdir -p $HOME/inst
cp -Rf perl/Triceps/blib/* $HOME/inst/
</pre>

		<para>
		You can then set the environment variable
		</para>

<pre>
export PERL5LIB=$HOME/inst/lib:$HOME/inst/arch
</pre>

		<para>
		to have your private hierarchy prepended to the Perl's standard
		library path. You can then insert <quote><pre>use Triceps;</pre></quote>
		and the Triceps module will be found. If you want to have the man
		pages from that directory working too, set
		</para>

<pre>
export MANPATH=$HOME/inst:$MANPATH
</pre>

		<para>
		Not that Triceps has any usable man pages at the moment.
		</para>

		<para>
		However if you're building a package that uses Triceps and
		will be shipped to the customer and/or deployed to a production
		machine, placing the libraries into the
		home directory is still not the best idea. Not only you don't
		want to pollute the random home directories, you also want to
		make sure that your libraries get picked up, and not the ones
		that might happen to be installed on the machine from
		some other sources (because they may be of different versions,
		or completely different libraries that accidentaly have the
		same name).
		</para>

		<para>
		The best idea then is to copy Triceps and all the other
		libraries into your distribution package, and have the binaries
		(including the scripts) find them by a relative path.
		</para>

		<para>
		Suppose you build the package prototype in the <pre>$PKGDIR</pre>,
		with the binaries and scripts located in the subdirectory <pre>bin</pre>, and the
		Triceps library located in the subdirectory <pre>blib</pre>.
		When you build your package, you install the Triceps library in that
		prototype by
		</para>

<pre>
cp -Rf perl/Triceps/blib $PKGDIR/
</pre>

		<para>
		Then this package gets archived, sent to the destination machine and
		unarchived. Whatever the package type, <pre>tar</pre>, <pre>cpio</pre> 
		or <pre>rpm</pre>, doesn't matter.
		The relative paths under it stay the same. For example,
		if it gets installed under <pre>/opt/my_package</pre>, the directory
		hierarchy would look like this:
		</para>

<pre>
/opt/my_package
     +- bin
     |  +- my_program.pl
     +- blib
        +- ... Triceps stuff ...
</pre>

		<para>
		The script <pre>my_program.pl</pre> can then use the following code at the
		top to load the Triceps package:
		</para>

<!-- t/xRunAnywhere.t -->
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use File::Basename;

# This is the magic sequence that adds the relative include paths.
BEGIN {
	my $mypath = dirname($0);
	unshift @INC, "${mypath}/../blib/lib", "${mypath}/../blib/arch";
}

use Triceps;
</pre>

		<para>
		It finds its own path from <pre>$0</pre>, by taking its directory name. Then it
		adds the relative directories for the Perl modules and XS shared libraries
		to the include path. And finally loads Triceps using the modified
		include path. Of course, more paths for more packages can be added
		as well. The script can also use that own directory (if saved into a global
		instead of <pre>my</pre> variable) to run the other programs later,
		find the configuration files and so on.
		</para>

	<sect1 id="sc_build_install_cpp">
		<title>Installation of the &Cpp; library</title>

		<indexterm>
			<primary>installation</primary>
		</indexterm>

		<para>
		There are no special install scripts for the &Cpp; libraries and includes.
		To build your &Cpp; code with Triceps, simply specify the location of Triceps
		sources and built libraries with options <pre>-I</pre> and <pre>-L</pre>. For example, if
		you have built Triceps in <pre>$HOME/srcs/triceps-1.0.0</pre>, you can add
		the following to your Makefile:
		</para>

<pre>
TRICEPSBASE=$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-1.0.0
CFLAGS += -I$(TRICEPSBASE)/cpp -DTRICEPS_NSPR4
LDFLAGS += -L$(TRICEPSBASE)/cpp/build -ltriceps -lnspr4 -pthread
</pre>

		<para>
		The Triceps include files expect that the Triceps &Cpp; subdirectory
		is directly in the include path as shown.
		</para>

		<para>
		The exact set of <pre>-D</pre> flags and extra <pre>-l</pre> libraries may vary with the Triceps
		configuration. To get the exact ones used in the configuration, run the special
		configuration <pre>make</pre> targets:
		</para>

<pre>
make --quiet -f cpp/Makefile.inc getconf
make --quiet -f cpp/Makefile.inc getxlib
</pre>

		<para>
		The additions to <pre>CFLAGS</pre> are returned by <pre>getconf</pre>. The additional external
		libraries for <pre>LDFLAGS</pre> are returned by <pre>getxlib</pre>. It's important
		to use the same settings in the build of Triceps itself and of the user programs.
		The differing settings may cause the program to crash.
		</para>

		<para>
		If you build your code with the dynamic library, the best packaging practice is to
		copy the <pre>libtriceps.so</pre> to the same directory where your binary is
		located and specify its location with the build flags (for GCC, the flags of other
		compilers may vary):
		</para>

<pre>
LDFLAGS += "-Wl,-rpath='$$ORIGIN/.'"
</pre>

		<para>
		Or any relative path would do. For example, if your binary package contains
		the binaries in the subdirectory <pre>bin</pre> and the libraries in the subdirectory
		<pre>lib</pre>, the setting for the path of the libraries relative
		to the binaries will be:
		</para>

<pre>
LDFLAGS += "-Wl,-rpath='$$ORIGIN/../lib'"
</pre>

		<para>
		But locating the binaries and the shared libraries won't work if Triceps and your
		program get ever ported to Windows. Windows searches for the DLLs only in the
		same directory.
		</para>

		<para>
		Or it might be easier to build your code with the static library: just
		instead of <pre>-ltriceps</pre>, link explicitly with
		<pre>$(TRICEPSBASE)/cpp/build/libtriceps.a</pre> and the libraries it
		requires:
		</para>

<pre>
LDFLAGS += $(TRICEPSBASE)/cpp/build/libtriceps.a -lpthread -lnspr4
</pre>
	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="sc_build_disambig_cpp">
		<title>Disambiguation of the &Cpp; library</title>

		<para>
		A problem with the shared libraries is that you never know, which
		exact library will end up linked at run time. The system library
		path takes priority over the one specified in <pre>-rpath</pre>.
		So if somene has installed a Triceps shared library system-wide,
		it would be found and used instead of your one. And it might be
		of a completely different version. Or some other package might
		have messed with <pre>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre> in the user's <pre>.profile</pre>, and
		inserted its path with its own version of Triceps.
		</para>

		<para>
		Messing with <pre>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre> is bad. The good solution
		is to give your libraries some unique name, so that it would
		not get confused. Instead of <pre>libtriceps.so</pre>, name it
		something like <pre>libtriceps_my_corp_my_project_v_123.so</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		Triceps can build the libraries with such names directly.
		To change the name, edit <pre>cpp/Makefile.inc</pre> and change
		</para>

<pre>
LIBRARY := triceps
</pre>

		<para>
		to
		</para>

<pre>
LIBRARY := triceps_my_corp_my_project_v_123
</pre>

		<para>
		and it will produce the custom-named library. The Perl part of the build
		detects this name change automatically and still works (though for the
		Perl build it doesn't change much, the static &Cpp; Triceps library gets
		linked into the XS-produced shared library).
		</para>

		<para>
		There is also a special <pre>make</pre> target to get back the base name
		of the Triceps library:
		</para>

<pre>
make --quiet -f cpp/Makefile.inc getlib
</pre>

		<para>
		The other potential naming conflict could happen with both shared and
		dynamic libraries. It appears when you want to link two different versions
		of the library into the same binary. This is needed rarely, but still needed.
		If nothing special is done, the symbol names in two libraries clash and nothing works.
		Triceps provides a way around it by having an opportunity to rename the
		&Cpp; namespaces, instead of the default namespace <quote><pre>Triceps</pre></quote>. 
		It can be done again by editing <pre>cpp/Makefile.inc</pre>
		and modifying the setting <pre>TRICEPS_CONF</pre>:
		</para>

<pre>
TRICEPS_CONF += -DTRICEPS_NS=TricepsMyVersion
</pre>

		<para>
		Suppose that you have two Triceps versions that you want both to
		use in the same binary. Suppose that you are building them in
		<pre>$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-1.0.0</pre> and <pre>$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-2.0.0</pre>.
		</para>

		<para>
		Then you edit <pre>$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-1.0.0/cpp/Makefile.inc</pre> and
		put in there
		</para>

<pre>
TRICEPS_CONF += -DTRICEPS_NS=Triceps1
</pre>

		<para>
		And in <pre>$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-2.0.0/cpp/Makefile.inc</pre> put
		</para>

<pre>
TRICEPS_CONF += -DTRICEPS_NS=Triceps2
</pre>

		<para>
		If you use the shared libraries, you need to disambiguate their names too,
		as described above, but for the static libraries you don't have to.
		</para>

		<para>
		Almost there, but you need to have your code use the different namespaces
		for different versions too. The good practice is to include in your files
		</para>

<pre>
#include <common/Conf.h>
</pre>

		<para>
		and then use everywhere the Triceps namespace <pre>TRICEPS_NS</pre> instead of <pre>Triceps</pre>.
		Then as long as one source file deals with only one version of Triceps,
		it can be easily manipulated to which version to use by providing that
		version in the include path. And you get your program to work with two
		versions of Triceps by linking the object files produces from these
		source files together into one binary.
		Then you just build some of your files
		with <pre>-I$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-1.0.0/cpp</pre> and some with 
		<pre>-I$(HOME)/srcs/triceps-2.0.0/cpp</pre> and avoid any conflicts
		or code changes.
		</para>

		<para>
		At the link time, you will need to link with the libraries from both versions.
		</para>

	<sect1 id="sc_build_config">
		<title>Build configuration settings</title>

		<para>
		Since Triceps has no autoconfiguration yet, it may need to be configured
		manually for the target operating system. The same method is used for the

		<para>
		The configuration options are set in the file <pre>cpp/Makefile.inc</pre>.
