What is Triceps
===============

It happened that I've worked for a while on and with the Complex Event
Processing (CEP) systems. I've worked for a few years on the internals
of the Aleri CEP engine, then after Aleri acquired Coral8, some on the
Coral8 engine, then after Sybase gobbled up them both, I've designed and
did the early implementation of a fair bit of the Sybase CEP R5. After
that I've moved on to Deutsche Bank and got the experience from the
other side: using the CEP systems, primarily the former Coral8, now
known as Sybase CEP R4.

This made me feel that writing the CEP models is unnecessarily
difficult. Even the essentially simple things take too much effort. I've
had this feeling before as well, but one thing is to have it in
abstract, and another is to grind against it every day.

Which in turn led me to thinking about making my own open-source CEP
system, where I could try out the ideas I get, and make the streaming
models easier to write. Thus the Triceps project was born. For a while
it was called Biceps, until I learned of the existence of a recearch
project called BiCEP. It's spelled differently, and is in a
substantially differnt area of CEP work, but it's easier to avoid
confusion, so I went one better and renamed it Triceps.
