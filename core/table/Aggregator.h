	// @param table - table on which the change happens
	// @param gadget - gadget of this aggregator, where to send the Rowops
	// @param index - index on which this aggregator is defined, contains the row of the group;
	//        to get data from the index use begin(), next().
	// @param parentIndexType - type of the parent index, that can be used for operations
	//        in the group handle
	// @param gh - handle of the group where index belongs; the most important use is to get
	//        the group size as: parentIndexType->groupSize(gh); but also can be used
	//        to get access to other indexes in the same group, all of them will contain
	//        the same set of rows but possibly in different order
	// @param aggop - the reason for this call
	// @param opcode - the Rowop opcode that would be normally used for the records
	//        produced in this operation (INSERT, DELETE, NOP), so that the simpler
	//        aggregators can ignore aggop and just go by opcode. When multiple records
	//        are changed in one table operation, the calls for all but the last records 
	//        will have the opcode NOP. The last one will normally have INSERT.
	//        The sending of old state (AO_BEFORE_MOD or AO_COLLAPSE) generally has
	//        the opcode DELETE.
	// @param rh - row that has been inderted or deleted, if deleted then it will be
	//        already not in table; may be NULL if aggop just requires the sending of
	//        the old state (such as AO_BEFORE_MOD or AO_COLLAPSE).
